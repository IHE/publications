  "introduction" : "The Medication Prescription and Dispense (MPD) profile defines profiles and actors for interoperable systems handling medication ordering and dispensing.  \n\nBased on the previous work done in the IHE Pharmacy Technical Framework, the MPD profile uses FHIR and is designed to support the exchange of medication orders and dispenses between healthcare providers, pharmacies, and other stakeholders in the medication management process.  \n\nThe MPD profile supports several use cases - some examples:\n\n- ordering (from draft or proposed orders to actionable prescriptions);\n\n- order grouping (i.e. multiline prescriptions);\n\n- instance ordering (i.e. dispense requests);\n\n- dispense (including partial dispense, declined dispense).\n\n"
