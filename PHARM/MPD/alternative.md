### Prescription Placer (name TBC) 
This actors groups together all previous actors that had something to do with ordering and validation of the order.
So it couples together traditional concepts such as planner, ordering, reviewer or  validation.
This actor can be impersonated by a physician, a pharmacist, a clinical decision support system or a team.

The actions are mainly planning, drafting, reviewing and/or validating medication orders.
