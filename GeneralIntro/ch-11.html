      <p>
        <span>Attention is called to the possibility that implementation of the specifications in IHE Technical Frameworks may require use of subject matter covered by patent rights. By publication of these documents, no position is taken with respect to the existence or validity of any patent rights in connection therewith. IHE International is not responsible for identifying Necessary Patent Claims for which a license may be required, for conducting inquiries into the legal validity or scope of Patents Claims or determining whether any licensing terms or conditions provided in connection with submission of a Letter of Assurance, if any, or in any licensing agreements are reasonable or non-discriminatory. Users of the specifications in this document are expressly advised that determination of the validity of any patent rights, and the risk of infringement of such rights, is entirely their own responsibility.
