The codes defined here are endpoint types defined in IHE profiles at the time of publication.  Other codes might be defined in new IHE profiles written later, where they could define their own code and own codeSystem.  Code pattern: `{Profile}-{Actor}-{Transaction}[-{option}]` * Where Profile is the acronym * Where Actor name compressed to be short yet clear (camel case) * Where Transaction name is compressed to be short yet clear (camel case) * Where the code definition spells out these using the formal names and transaction number * Where an option is important it can be prepended  Note that this codeSystem contains only endpoints needed for Some IHE profiles, and only for the synchronous communication pattern. When Async is supported additional entries will be needed on these actors, and the peer actor will also need to be described. Async is not in scope at this time.","ValueSet/MCSDEndpointTypesCoreDocShareVS,ValueSet/MCSDEndpointTypesVS"
