      <p>Support of continuations is described in transaction [ITI-47]. This option allows the Patient Demographics Consumer to get the full set of responses in several increments, as opposed to in one single response.</p>
      <h3 id="24.2.2">24.2.2Pediatric Demographics Option</h3>
      <p>The experience of immunization registries and other public health population databases has shown that matching and linking patient records from different sources for the same individual person in environments with large proportions of pediatric records requires additional demographic data.</p>
      <p>In particular, distinguishing records for children who are twins, triplets, etc. – that is, avoiding false positive matches - may be difficult because much of the demographic data for the two individuals matches. For instance, twin children may have identical last names, parents, addresses, and dates of birth; their first names may be very similar, possibly differing by only one letter. It can be very difficult for a computer or even a human being to determine in this situation whether the slight first name difference points to two distinct individuals or just a typographical error in one of the records. Additional information is extremely helpful in making this determination.</p>
      <p>Pediatric Demographics makes use of the following six additional demographic fields to aid record matching in databases with many pediatric records.</p>

      <p>Section 8.3 describes use cases that this profile addresses. Figure 8.3-1 also applies to this profile with the changes to the corresponding PDQV3 transactions as specified in Table 24.1-2, and omitting transaction [ITI-22], which has no correspondence in this profile.</p>
      <h3 id="24.3.1">24.3.1 Combined Use of PDQV3 with other IHE Workflow Profiles</h3>
      <p>In addition to the discussion in Section 8.3.1, the use of web services as the transport in the transactions in this profile makes it well suited in cases where other web services-based profiles are used, like XDS.b and PIXV3.</p>
      <h3 id="24.3.2">24.3.2 Supplier Data Configuration</h3>
      <p>
        The Patient Demographics Supplier provides demographics information about possible matches to the parameters of the query. As described in
        <a href="../Volume2x/ch-13.html#Appendix M">ITI TF-2x: Appendix M</a>
        , while it is possible for the supplier to have demographics information from multiple domains, only a single set of demographics shall be returned by the supplier.
      </p>
      <p>If the supplier holds information for a single Patient ID domain, it shall provide the demographics information from that domain. In the case where the supplier holds demographics information from multiple Patient ID domains, the determination of which set of information to return must be based on the ID values for the Receiver’s Device and Organization classes of the query transmission wrapper (the equivalent of MSH-5 and MSH-6 in the HL7 Version 2.5 corresponding message).</p>

      <h2 id="24.5">24.5 Security Considerations</h2>
      <p>The implementer of this profile is advised that many risks cannot be mitigated by the IHE profile and instead the responsibility for mitigation is transferred to the vendor, and occasionally to the operational environment.</p>
      <p>In order to address identified security risks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet-list1">All actors in PDQV3 should be grouped with a Consistent Time (CT) Profile - Time Client. This grouping will assure that all systems have a consistent time clock to assure a consistent timestamp for audit logging.</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">All actors in PDQV3 should be grouped with an Audit Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA) Profile - Secure Node or ATNA Secure Application Actor. This grouping will assure that only highly trusted systems can communicate and that all changes are recorded in the audit log.</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">All actors in PDQV3 should be grouped with a Cross-Enterprise User Assertion (XUA) X-Service User or X-Service Provider as appropriate. This grouping will enable service side access control and more detailed audit logging.</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">All actors in PDQV3 should be grouped with the appropriate actor from the Enterprise User Authentication (EUA) Profile to enable single sign-on inside an enterprise by facilitating one name per user for participating devices and software.</li>
