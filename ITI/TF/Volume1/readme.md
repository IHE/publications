This folder holds each chapter of Volume 1 as independently addressable pages. There may be other content here to support such as images. 

Thus each Profile will be represented here as <profile acronym>.html, and a redirect for <profile name>.html

Each Volume 1 appendix will also be addressible here.

Links will go from this content to the Transaction or Content Specifications

index.html in this folder will itemize the content much like the table-of-content supports Volume today

Here is what Pandoc creates as one monolighic html ./vol1.html

Here is what I created from the pandoc by splitting up each chapter into numbered html files ./chapters.html
