      <p>
        <span>This profile describes the use of subscription and notification mechanism for use within an XDS Affinity Domain and across communities. The subscription allows for the matching of metadata during the publication of a new document for a given patient, and results in the delivery of a notification. This profile is based on the OASIS WS-BaseNotification standard and defines a “Push-style” method for notification. Using a “Push-style” method of notification, theDocument Metadata Subscriber may subscribe on behalf of the Document Metadata Notification Recipient to receive notifications about the availability of documents based on specific criteria. A Document Metadata Notification Broker keeps track of the subscriptions and sends the appropriate notifications based on the registration of objects in an XDS Document Registry. Subscriptions exist for a certain period of time and can be canceled.</span>

      <h4 id="26.1.1.1">26.1.1.1 Document Metadata Notification Broker</h4>
      <p>The Document Metadata Notification Broker is the receiver of the Document Metadata Subscribe transaction containing a subscription request, or a subscription cancellation. It keeps track of all subscriptions it receives, including the time limits of subscriptions. Based on the metadata associated with document registrations, this actor sends notifications to interested subscribers. This actor may optionally receive Document Metadata Publish transactions representing the stream of events against which the existing subscriptions are matched.</p>
      <h4 id="26.1.1.2">26.1.1.2 Document Metadata Subscriber</h4>
      <p>The Document Metadata Subscriber initiates and terminates subscriptions on behalf of a Document Metadata Notification Recipient.</p>
      <h4 id="26.1.1.3">26.1.1.3 Document Metadata Publisher</h4>
      <p>The Document Metadata Publisher sends a Document Metadata Publish transaction to the Document Metadata Notification Broker when an event occurs for which a subscription may exist. This profile does not specify how the Document Metadata Publisher becomes aware of those events.</p>
      <h4 id="26.1.1.4">26.1.1.4 Document Metadata Notification Recipient</h4>

      <h5 id="26.4.2.1.1">26.4.2.1.1 Unexpected Notification Use Case Description</h5>
      <p>A patient in the emergency department has all her relevant available documents retrieved via XDS transactions. As initial triage of the patient is done, an additional document regarding diagnostic results for this patient is registered in the XDS Document Registry. Currently, there is no way for the Emergency department to learn about the existence of this new information. With a publish/subscribe infrastructure, the initial query to the XDS Document Registry would be accompanied with a subscription request, as a result of which a notification would be sent to the emergency department. The subscription will be terminated once the patient is no longer under the care of the emergency department's institution.</p>

      <p>A patient visits his PCP after being discharged from a hospital that belongs to the same XDS Affinity Domain as the provider's organization. The provider sends a query to the XDS Document Registry, and retrieves the hospital discharge summary. The patient also has follow-up visits with a specialist at the hospital, and these visit summaries (including diagnostic test results) are registered in the XDS Document Registry. Currently, the PCP would have to periodically query the Document Registry for documents about the patient in order to retrieve the follow-up visit summaries. With a publish/subscribe infrastructure, the PCP would have a subscription for all his patients, so that notifications would have been received as the summaries were registered in the XDS Document Registry.</p>

As the patient is seen over a finite period in the office, aggregation of specific relevant data important to the evaluation of the obstetric patient upon presentation to Labor and Delivery is captured on paper forms. The antepartum documents contain the most critical information needed including the ongoing Medical Diagnoses, the Estimated Due Date, outcomes of any prior pregnancies, serial visit data on the appropriate growth of the uterus and assessments of fetal well-being, authorizations, laboratory and imaging studies. This data must all be presented and evaluated upon entry to the Labor and Delivery Suite to ensure optimal care for the patient and the fetus.</td>

This publishing event matches the existing subscription and a notification is sent by the Document Metadata Notification Broker to Dr. Brown’s system (identified as Document Metadata Notification Recipient in the subscription created). Dr. Brown can quickly analyze the report published and can make other clinical decisions in an efficient way.</p>

      <h4 id="26.4.2.5">26.4.2.5 Use Case #5: Workflow Id subscription</h4>
      <p>In this use case a clinician creates a subscription for a specific instance of workflow (e.g., eReferral Workflow) because he wants to be notified of any updates that occurred to the workflow. The workflow Id is stored in the metadata XDSDocumentEntry.ReferenceIdList.</p>
      <h5 id="26.4.2.5.1">26.4.2.5.1 Workflow Id subscription Use Case Description</h5>
      <p>Dr. Brown is a GP. He decides to refer his patient Mr. White to another healthcare provider to have a specialist’s consultation. Dr. Brown does not take part in subsequent steps of the Referral process, but he wants to be notified of any relevant progress related to the workflow. Mr. White calls the specialist, Dr. Green, to schedule the specialist consultation. Dr. Brown is notified of this event.</p>
      <p>On the day of the visit, the patient is admitted in Dr. Green’s office. Dr. Green analyzes the referral request created by Dr. White and any useful Clinical Documents related to the request. When the visit is completed, Dr. Green publishes a report and Dr. Brown is notified of the completion of the eReferral process so that he can analyze the whole workflow and all related documents.</p>
      <h6 id="26.4.2.5.1.1">26.4.2.5.1.1 Technical Aspects (Workflow Id and XDSDocumentEntry ReferenceIdList subscription)</h6>
      <p>The eReferral process is managed and tracked by the creation of a specific Workflow Document (e.g., as defined in the IHE PCC Cross-enterprise Basic eReferral Workflow Definition Profile (XBeR-WD)). The Workflow Document has a unique fixed reference, the workflow Id, which is stored in the XDSDocumentEntry.ReferenceIdList metadata.</p>
      <p>The GP’s system creates this Workflow Document and a related subscription that identifies the specific workflow Id as filter parameter for the creation of notifications. From this time, any update of the workflow document will result in the creation and the delivery of a notification to the GP, because the Workflow Id remains the same during the whole evolution of the workflow. For example, the scheduling phase involves the creation of a new version of the Workflow Document characterized by the same workflow Id. This scheduling event triggers the creation of a notification that is sent to the GP.</p>
      <p>The execution of the visit involves another update of the workflow document and, as consequence, a new notification is sent to the GP.</p>
      <p>This notification framework allows the GP to be active participant in the process started by him.</p>

      <p>
        <span>The risk analysis for this profile enumerates assets, threats, and mitigations. The risk assessment spreadsheet is stored and available from IHE at</span>
        <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/images/4/46/DSUB_risk_assesment.xls">http://wiki.ihe.net/images/4/46/DSUB_risk_assesment.xls</a>
        <span>.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this risk assessment is to notify implementers of some of the risks that they need to consider in implementing DSUB actors. For general IHE risks and threats please see
        <a href="../Volume1/ch-L.html#Appendix L">ITI TF-1: Appendix L</a>
        . The implementers are also advised that many risks cannot be mitigated by the IHE profile and instead the responsibility for mitigation is transferred to the implementer, and occasionally to the XDS Affinity Domain and enterprises. In these instances, IHE’s responsibility to notify affected parties is fulfilled through the following section.
      </p>
      <p>A policy decision can be made during the Subscribe transaction, whether the subscription is an authorized subscription and whether a notification/type of notification is authorized. (This could be based on the XUA identity, the consumer address value, etc.)</p>
      <p>This profile does not include the solution to changes of policy between the subscribe time and notify time (which can be substantial). The recommendation is that the policy is enforced conservatively (i.e., the length of subscription can be determined by the Document Metadata Notification Broker). An approach allows the access of content published in accordance to consent given by the patient. The consent is dynamic and can change during time. The availability of content can be discovered only asking the document-sharing infrastructure. The creation of subscription is not dependent to access policies rules. If the Document Metadata Notification Broker sends the references, then the control of access policies is in query/retrieve transactions of the Document Metadata Notification Recipient.</p>
      <p>Specific security considerations are presented in the Security Considerations section of each transaction in Volume 2.</p>
