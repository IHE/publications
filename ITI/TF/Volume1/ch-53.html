    <h1 class="list-paragraph" id="Appendix P">Appendix P: Privacy Access Policies (Informative)</h1>
    <p>This Appendix provides information about when consent could be automated and consequently when the BPPC Profile could be used. Privacy consent can be summarized as: "I agree on my personal data being disclosed to someone under specific conditions".</p>
    <p>Conditions are based on various factor(s) for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>type of person the data is disclosed to;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>type of data disclosed;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>type of access (normal access, emergency access...);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>security level in which the disclosure takes place (weak authentication vs. strong authentication);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>type of purpose for which the data is disclosed;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>timeframe (period of validity of the consent, window of disclosure...);</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>BPPC could be used when conditions can be described with a limited number of factors and when the factors can be defined and be easily interpreted by a Document Consumer implementing the Basic Patient Privacy Enforcement Option.</p>
    <p>The XDS Affinity Domain Privacy Consent Policies could result in various actions, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>limitation of the display of the existence of specific documents to the users of a Document Consumer</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>limitation of the access to specific documents by the users of a Document Consumer</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>display of a warning note (either concerning this access or to inform that further disclosure is not allowed, limited to some defined population, needed further consent...)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>collection of new consent (oral consent, patient authentication, electronically signed consent, paper consent...)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      P.1 Consents in a sensitivity labeled and role based access control environment
    </h2>
    <p>One possible implementation may have a collection of policies and sensitivity markers that would form an access control matrix. An example simple access control matrix is shown in the table below.</p>

    <p>Each instance of the matrix results in a single Patient Privacy Policy. This vocabulary must then be configured in the XDS Affinity Domain. Thus configuring each application in the XDS Affinity Domain to recognize for each Patient Privacy Policy identified, and which sensitivity (confidentialityCode); what types of accesses are allowed. Using the example above, the Patient Privacy Policy might look like.</p>

    <p>Possible things that the BPPC policies might include are not fully known at this time. The following is a list that has been discovered through use by researchers, health information exchanges, and vendors. The following are some thoughts of things that might be orchestrated by BPPC Policies.</p>
    <p>General</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Is the existence (metadata) about a document that can't be read by the user shown in a list of available documents for this patient</p>

    <ol start="16" type="1">
      <li>

    <ol start="17" type="1">
      <li>
        <p>the specific Document Source is configured with one site specific “normal” code to publish all of that Document Source documents against. For example, an automatic blood-pressure device being used by one specific patient.</p>

      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="Appendix P.4">P.4 Dynamic Use Models</h2>
    <p>It has also been suggested that documents should simply be published with the expected codes, and that only on use of a document that ALL current Patient Privacy Policy Acknowledgements are evaluated against with the code on the document. In this way revocation is more dynamic.</p>
