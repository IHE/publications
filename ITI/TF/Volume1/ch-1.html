          <p>This document, Volume 1 of the IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Technical Framework, describes the clinical use
            cases, actors, content module, and transaction requirements for the ITI profiles.</p>
          <h2 id="1.1">1.1 Introduction to IHE</h2>
          <p>Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) is an international initiative to promote the use of standards
            to achieve interoperability among health information technology (HIT) systems and effective use of
            electronic health records (EHRs). IHE provides a forum for care providers, HIT experts and other
            stakeholders in several clinical and operational domains to reach consensus on standards-based solutions to
            critical interoperability issues.</p>
          <p>The primary output of IHE is system implementation guides, called IHE profiles. IHE publishes each profile
            through a well-defined process of public review and Trial Implementation and gathers profiles that have
            reached Final Text status into an IHE Technical Framework, of which this volume is a part.</p>
          <p>For general information regarding IHE, refer to
            <a href="http://www.ihe.net">www.ihe.net</a>.
            It is strongly recommended that, prior to reading this volume, the reader familiarizes themselves with the
            concepts defined in the
            <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/GeneralIntro/">IHE Technical Frameworks General Introduction</a>.
          </p>
          <h2 id="1.2">1.2 Introduction to IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Technical Framework</h2>
          <p>
              This document, the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework (ITI TF), defines
              specific implementations of established standards to achieve integration goals that promote appropriate
              sharing of medical information to support optimal patient care. It is expanded annually, after a period of
              public review, and maintained regularly through the identification and correction of errata. The latest
              version of the document is always available at
            <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/index.html">http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/index.html</a>.
          </p>
          <p>The IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework identifies a subset of the functional components of the
            healthcare enterprise, called IHE actors, and specifies their interactions in terms of a set of coordinated,
            standards-based transactions. It describes this body of transactions in progressively greater depth. The
            present volume (ITI TF-1) provides a high-level view of IHE functionality, showing the transactions
            organized into functional units called integration profiles that highlight their capacity to address
            specific IT Infrastructure requirements.</p>
          <h2 id="1.3">1.3 Intended Audience</h2>
          <p>The intended audience of IHE Technical Frameworks Volume 1 (Profiles) is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-list1">Those interested in integrating healthcare information systems and workflows</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1">IT departments of healthcare institutions</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1">Technical staff of vendors participating in the IHE initiative</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="1.4">1.4 Prerequisites and Reference Material</h2>

          <h2 id="1.11">1.11 Security Implications</h2>
          <p>IHE transactions often contain information that must be protected in conformance with privacy laws and
            regulations, such as HIPAA, GDPR, or similar requirements in other regions. IHE includes a few security and
            privacy-focused profiles listed below. Other IHE Profiles generally do not have specific privacy
            protections, but rather expect a proper grouping with one or more of the security profiles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-9.html">Audit Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA)</a> Profile specifies a means to ensure that nodes in a network are authenticated.</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-9.html">ATNA</a> Profile specifies an audit message for reporting security- and privacy-relevant events.</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-4.html">Enterprise User Authentication (EUA)</a> Profile specifies a means to authenticate system users and to share knowledge of the authenticated users among applications.</li>
			<li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-13.html">Cross-Enterprise User Assertion(XUA)</a> Profile provides a means to carry federated user assertions for authentication and authorization.</li>
			<li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-34.html">Internet User Authorization (IUA)</a> Profile provides a means to use OAuth security authorization tokens with http RESTful services (e.g. FHIR).</li>
			<li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-19.html">Basic Patient Privacy Consents (BPPC)</a> Profile provides a means for Patient Privacy Policy Domain (e.g., an XDS Affinity Domain) to have a number of Patient Privacy Policies that can be acknowledged (aka consent) by a Patient.</li>
			<li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-43.html">Advanced Patient Privacy Consents (APPC)</a> Profile enables the capturing of consent(s) that cannot be adequately expressed using the Basic Patient Privacy Consents (BPPC) Profile.</li>
			<li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-37.html">Document Digital Signature (DSG)</a> Profile defines general purpose methods of digitally signing of documents for communication and persistence.</li>
			<li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-32.html">Document Encryption (DEN)</a> Profile defines general purpose methods of digitally encrypting a document for communication and persistence.</li>
			<li class="bullet-list1">The <a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-39.html">Secure Retrieve (SeR)</a> Profile defines access control decision and enforcement mechanism for use with XDS.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Implementers may follow these IHE profiles to fulfill some of their security needs. It is understood that
            institutions must implement policy and workflow steps to satisfy enterprise needs and to comply with
            regulatory requirements.</p>
