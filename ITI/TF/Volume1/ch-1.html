    <h1 xmlns="" id="1">1         Introduction</h1>
    <p xmlns="">This document, Volume 1 of the IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Technical Framework, describes the clinical use cases, actors, content module, and transaction requirements for the ITI profiles.</p>
    <h2 xmlns="" id="1.1">1.1      Introduction to IHE</h2>
    <p xmlns="">Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) is an international initiative to promote the use of standards to achieve interoperability among health information technology (HIT) systems and effective use of electronic health records (EHRs). IHE provides a forum for care providers, HIT experts and other stakeholders in several clinical and operational domains to reach consensus on standards-based solutions to critical interoperability issues.</p>
    <p xmlns="">The primary output of IHE is system implementation guides, called IHE profiles. IHE publishes each profile through a well-defined process of public review and Trial Implementation and gathers profiles that have reached Final Text status into an IHE Technical Framework, of which this volume is a part.</p>

        <span>This document, the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework (ITI TF), defines specific implementations of established standards to achieve integration goals that promote appropriate sharing of medical information to support optimal patient care. It is expanded annually, after a period of public review, and maintained regularly through the identification and correction of errata.</span>

    <p xmlns="">The IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework identifies a subset of the functional components of the healthcare enterprise, called IHE actors, and specifies their interactions in terms of a set of coordinated, standards-based transactions. It describes this body of transactions in progressively greater depth. The present volume (ITI TF-1) provides a high-level view of IHE functionality, showing the transactions organized into functional units called integration profiles that highlight their capacity to address specific IT Infrastructure requirements.</p>
    <h2 xmlns="" id="1.3">1.3      Intended Audience</h2>

    <h2 xmlns="" id="1.11">1.11 Security Implications</h2>
    <p xmlns="">IHE transactions often contain information that must be protected in conformance with privacy laws and regulations, such as HIPAA or similar requirements in other regions. IHE includes a few security and privacy-focused profiles listed below. Other IHE Profiles generally do not have specific privacy protections, but rather expect a proper grouping with one or more of the security profiles:</p>
    <ul xmlns="" type="disc" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt">
      <li style="margin-top:6pt;margin-left:28.52pt;padding-left:7.48pt">
        <span>The Audit Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA) Profile specifies a means to ensure that nodes in a network are authenticated.</span>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-top:6pt;margin-left:28.52pt;padding-left:7.48pt">
        <span>The ATNA Profile specifies an audit message for reporting security- and privacy-relevant events.</span>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-top:6pt;margin-left:28.52pt;padding-left:7.48pt">
        <span>The Enterprise User Authentication (EUA) Profile specifies a means to authenticate system users and to share knowledge of the authenticated users among applications.</span>
      </li>
      <li style="margin-top:6pt;margin-left:28.52pt;padding-left:7.48pt">
        <span>The Personnel White Pages (PWP) Profile provides a repository that may be used to hold system users' identification data.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p xmlns="">Implementers may follow these IHE profiles to fulfill some of their security needs. It is understood that institutions must implement policy and workflow steps to satisfy enterprise needs and to comply with regulatory requirements.</p>
