    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The Cross-Enterprise User Assertion Profile (XUA) provides a means to communicate claims about an authenticated principal (user, application, system...) in transactions that cross enterprise boundaries. To provide accountability in these cross-enterprise transactions there is a need to identify the requesting user in a way that enables the receiver to make access decisions and proper audit entries. The XUA Profile supports many solutions including enterprises that have chosen to have their own user directory with their own unique method of authenticating the users, and others that have chosen to use a third party to perform the authentication.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>There are transactions defined by IHE that cross enterprise boundaries and are web-services based on <a href="../Volume2x/ch-22.html#Appendix V"><a href="../Volume2x/ch-22.html#Appendix V">ITI TF-2x: Appendix V</a></a>. The existing IHE profiles for an authenticated user identity (IHE Enterprise User Authentication Profile</span>

      <span>)</span>
      <span>) are not intended to function in cross-enterprise transactions. In a cross-enterprise environment it is more likely that the transactions will be going between two enterprises that maintain their own independent user directories (IHE Personnel White Pages [PWP]). This type of requirement is the focus of the Identity Federation standards. Identity Federation has received much attention by the security and the platforms industry. Identity Federation is agnostic to the type of user directory; it allows for a centralized user directory, but also supports the more powerful federation of user directories. Identity Federation supports:</span>

    <h2 xmlns="" id="13.1">13.1 Use Cases</h2>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The XUA Profile supports complex environments, for example one where two different trust domains are operating under different technology, procedures, role-models, etc. They are cooperating in the XDS Affinity domain under an overarching trust relationship policy (See <a href="../Volume2x/ch-12.html#Appendix L"><a href="../Volume2x/ch-12.html#Appendix L">ITI TF-2x: Appendix L</a></a>) that indicates that these differences can be rationalized. The XDS transactions are transferring control from one entity to another, for example, when using XDS to exchange data between a single doctor practice and large multi-site hospital. It is not likely that they will all agree to the same access control model (organizational roles, functional roles, workflows, permissions, etc.). It is not necessary to have the same access control across these entities, but it is reasonable that at the policy level they will agree to a set of processing rules. This illustrates an important fact that the XUA is useful for security audit logging, but is to a lesser extent useful for access controls.</span>

    <h2 xmlns="" id="13.2">13.2 XUA Development</h2>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The vast majority of the use-cases (items 1-11) rely on claims about an authenticated identity, which a SAML 2.0 Identity Assertion can provide. This is a mature standard produced by OASIS. XUA Profile is focused on Web-Services transactions that follow <a href="../Volume2x/ch-22.html#Appendix V"><a href="../Volume2x/ch-22.html#Appendix V">ITI TF-2x: Appendix V</a></a>. XUA specifies that when a Cross-Enterprise User Assertion is needed, these Web-Services transactions will additionally use the Web-Services Security header with a SAML 2.0 Token containing the identity Assertion. As with any IHE profile, the applications are not forbidden to use other methods of providing the principal (user) identity, providing that interoperability has been assured through some policy.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>A very clear need on all the use-cases is the recording of the user identity in any security audit logs. The XUA Profile does not define these auditable events. The need to record a security audit event is driven by the grouped transactions (e.g., Registry Stored Query, and Retrieve Document Set). XUA does specify how to reference the Identity Assertion in an ATNA Audit Message.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The method of authenticating the principal (user) and the method that the X-Service User (e.g., XDS.b Document Consumer) uses to get the Identity Assertion are outside the scope of this profile.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>There are principal (user) attributes that appear to be needed in the use-cases: Doctor, Patient, Guardian, Emergency-Access. The Identity Assertion can contain attributes about the principal (user). At this time it is not clear what standards to use to identify these attributes and their values, so this is left to specific implementations that have defined a local vocabulary or vocabulary translation.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The method used by the X-Service User (e.g., XDS.b Document Consumer) to determine the contents of the Identity Assertion is outside the scope of this profile. This might be accomplished using the SAML Metadata and WS-Policy.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>It is expected that extending this solution to HL7 and DICOM will be supported in the future.</span>

    <p xmlns="">
      <span>Role-Based-Access Control is a common architecture for managing and enforcing authorizations. In this model users are assigned to roles, and permissions are assigned to these roles. In this way the administration of permissions to users is grouped through roles. In an RBAC model these roles are well known and agreed to between the system that is managing users and the access control system. Given that a Federated Identity environment allows for a loose coupling of the Identity-Manager and the Access Control point, there is a need to have a well-defined vocabulary for the roles. This set of roles will likely expand over time and will be extended with local codes into a Value-Set within any specific Security-Domain.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>This option</span>
      <span>recommends that the Value-Set be derived from</span>
      <span>the role codes found in SNOMED-CT</span>
      <span>, ISO 21298, or ASTM E1986. The Value-Set used would bridge</span>
      <span>between different policy</span>
      <span>domain</span>
      <span>roles used in a client domain to those used in the service domain. In this way it is possible for local role definitions to be used as long as they can be bridged to the</span>
      <span>roles found in the selected Value-Set</span>
      <span>.</span>
      <span>Implementations should expect that the Value-Set used</span>
      <span>may be using</span>
      <span>locally defined values. The use of the IHE Sharing of Value-Sets (SVS) Profile may assist with this.</span>

      <span>a Patient may have provided a BPPC Consent/Authorization for treatment purposes, but explicitly disallowed any use for research regardless of de-identification methods used.

      <span>The X-Identity Assertion is valuable and must be protected against confidentiality risks. In some Profiles (e.g., XDS), there is already an inherited requirement to group with ATNA Secure Node or Secure Application Actor. This grouping forces the network transactions to utilize mutually authenticated and encrypted TLS or equivalent. This is leveraged by XUA to support the protection of the X-User Assertion to some risks to confidentiality and integrity. When ATNA Secure Node or Secure Application grouping is not required, there will need to be some other mechanism to protect the Provide X-User Assertion.</span>
