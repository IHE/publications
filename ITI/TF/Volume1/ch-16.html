          <p>
            Cross-Enterprise Document Media Interchange (XDM) provides document interchange using a common file and
            directory structure over several standard media types. This permits the patient to use physical media to
            carry medical documents. This also permits the use of person-to-person email to convey medical documents.
            XDM supports the transfer of data about multiple patients within one data exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Physician to patient to physician</strong> - Bob has an MRI and cancer is diagnosed. He is given a
            CD-R with his MRI results and referral information on it to give to the specialist of his choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Patient visiting ED</strong> - In addition, Bob, the informed patient, maintains a copy of his EHR
            record at home and can bring the CD-R with him when he visits the ED for an unrelated emergency.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Physician to physician</strong> - Dr. Primary refers his aging patient Mr. Robinson to his first
            appointment with a gastroenterology specialist. He transfers relevant documents in a zip file attached to an
            email to the specialist.
          </p>
          <p>The common thread of these use cases is that they are person-to-person communications. The XDM solution is
            intended to be easy to implement with pre-existing email clients, CD burners and USB ports. XDM does not
            include any additional reliability enhancements. XDM requires that the recipient be able to support human
            intervention in order to manually control the importing of the data (patient ID reconciliation, selection of
            patient of interest from possibly multiple patients’ documents on the media).</p>
          <p>XDM is document format agnostic, supporting the same document content as XDS and XDR. Document content is
            described in Document Content Profiles. Examples are XDS-MS, XPHR, XDS-SD, and XD-LAB.</p>
          <p>XDM defines no new metadata. It leverages XDS metadata with emphasis on patient identification, document
            identification, description, and relationships.</p>
          <p>A directory and file structure is documented for populating the media. This structure maintains separate
            areas for each patient listed and is supported on all referenced media types. Media and the structure were
            selected based on experience with media interoperability in Radiology, i.e., PDI Profile. The media selected
            are the widespread CD-R, USB removable media, and email with ZIP attachment.</p>
          <h2 id="16.1">16.1 XDM Actors/Transactions</h2>
          <p>Figure 16.1-1 shows the actors directly involved in the XDM Integration Profile and the relevant
            transactions between them. Other actors that may be indirectly involved due to their participation in XDS,
            PIX or PDI are not shown.

          <h2 id="16.3">16.3 XDM Process Flow</h2>
          <p>XDM describes the exchange of a set of a patient’s documents between healthcare providers, such as:
            physicians, hospitals, special care networks, or other healthcare professionals.</p>
          <p>Where XDS is not desirable or available for one of the participants in the exchange of information, XDM is
            a viable option.</p>
          <p>XDM should be used in a situation where the information receiver is an individual who will manually
            interpret or examine the data and associated documents as though they were using physical media. XDM also
            allows for the exchange of documents relating to multiple patients, since the data will be interpreted
            manually by human intervention.</p>
          <p>The XDM Integration Profile is intended only for exchange of personal medical documents and not intended to
            address all cross-enterprise EHR communication needs. Some use cases may require the use of other IHE
            integration profiles such as XDS, DSG, PIX, and ATNA. Other use cases may only be partially supported, while
            still others may require future IHE integration profiles.</p>

          <p>The media can be either CD-R or a USB media device because these are the most common media types in other
            industries for the portable transport of electronic information. This supplement requires using one of these
            media types, depending on the use case. The benefit and risks of the reusability of the media deployed
            should be taken into account, especially when the media is under the control of the patient.</p>

                    this
                    profile is following the restriction defined in the IHE RAD PDI Profile, to not use recordable DVD

          <h3 id="16.4.2">16.4.2 Virtual Media over a Network</h3>
          <p>The media can be a ZIP file containing the document set and sent via a secure email message.</p>
          <h3 id="16.4.3">16.4.3 Media Content</h3>
          <p>The requirements for media content are intended to promote the simple transfer of medical documents,
            including patient summaries, lab results, discharge letters and reports, and to allow for the viewing of
            such documents on general purpose computers by care providers or patients.</p>
          <p>Created media are required to contain documents and the relevant associated metadata.</p>
          <p>The media contains one or more Submission Sets including the documents and the associated metadata,
            organized in a well-defined directory structure starting at the root level.</p>
          <p>The media content can be made web viewable by a web browser by providing optional files containing HTML
            content. This content must be based on the original documents in order to ensure consistency. Any ordinary
            web browser can be used to read these files. The Portable Media Importer ignores these files. They are just
            intended for the human recipient.</p>
          <p>Additional content may be present (files, directories), but can be ignored by the Portable Media Importer.
          </p>
          <p>To summarize, the Portable Media Importer has two complementary ways to access the media and its content
            through a basic web browser:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-list1">By inspecting in the directory dedicated to XDM all the subdirectories that contain
              a specifically named metadata file compatible with XDM</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1">By presenting to the user the HTML index file that lists the submission sets and
              documents contained in the media.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Access to the content of an individual document is outside the scope of this Integration Profile and shall
            be addressed in specific IHE document content Integration Profiles.</p>
          <h2 id="16.5">16.5 Security Considerations</h2>
          <p>
            The Profile assumes that the Healthcare delivery organizations that are using Portable Media Creator and
            Importer have an agreement defining when they can interchange PHI. This may require an explicit patient
            consent (depending on existing regulations) and an agreement on how to manage the potential inconsistency
            between the security policies. The main aspects that should be covered by this agreement are similar to XDS
            – see
            <a href="../Volume1/ch-L.html#Appendix L">ITI TF-1: Appendix L</a>
            . In addition, the following aspects should be covered:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-list1">Management of Patient identification in order to perform patient reconciliation
              correctly upon importation of the documents.</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1">Measures taken to avoid or limit loss of media or email, and detect that which
              occurs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the case of physical media, security responsibilities for confidentiality and integrity are transferred
            to the patient by providing the media to the patient. In this case it is the patient’s responsibility to
            protect the media, and the patient has the authority to disclose the contents of the media as they choose.
            They disclose the contents by providing the media.</p>
          <p>The Portable Media Creator in most cases does not know who the ultimate Importer will be, thus rendering
            encryption impractical.</p>
          <p>In the case of transfer over email using a ZIP attachment, the transaction is secured by the use of S/MIME.

          <h2 id="16.6">16.6 Cross-Profile Considerations</h2>
          <h3 id="16.6.1">16.6.1 RAD Portable Data for Imaging (PDI)</h3>
          <p>A Portable Media Creator in XDM might be grouped with a Portable Media Creator in the RAD PDI Profile to
            enable it to include DICOM instances on the same media. A grouped PDI / XDM Media Creator application will
            handle the data for the media as defined for each actor by its profile. This grouping is described in RAD
            TF-2: 4.47.4.1.2.2.3.</p>
          <p>A Portable Media Importer in XDM might be grouped with a Portable Media Importer in the PDI Profile to
            process the combined PDI / XDM media, for example, for the use in an XDS-I infrastructure. A grouped PDI /
            XDM Media Importer application will handle the media data as defined for each actor by its profile. This
            grouping is described in RAD TF-2: 4.47.4.1.3.4.</p>
