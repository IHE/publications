      <h2 id="14.1">14.1 Patient Administration Management Use Cases</h2>
      <p>The Patient Administration Management Integration Profile defines transactions based on message exchanges to support patient identity and encounter information, as well as movements within an acute care encounter. These can be represented by the following use cases.</p>
      <h2 id="14.2">14.2 Patient Identity Management Use Case</h2>
      <p>A Patient Registration application decides to create a new patient John Smith, based on patient information input from Hospital Sun. At this time, however, there is a limited set of personal information traits of John Smith available. His date of birth, home address, and home phone number are unknown. The registration application creates the patient identity and sends a Patient Creation message to its downstream applications with the set of known personal information traits.</p>
      <p>The next day, detailed personal information about John Smith becomes available. The registration application updates its patient identity record, and sends out a Patient Update message.</p>
      <p>After a week, the registration application creates a temporary patient identity John Doe based on input from Imaging Center Moon. After reconciliation of the temporary patient, it updates John Doe’s demographics to (a new instance of) John Smith, and changes the temporary Patient Identifier originally assigned to a permanent identifier.</p>
      <p>After human inspection, it turns out that these two identities of John Smith represent the same person. The operator decides to merge the second identity to the previously established identity John Smith. A Patient Merge is communicated downstream.</p>
      <h3 id="14.2.1">14.2.1 Patient Encounter Management Use Case</h3>
      <p>Patient Alan Alpha arrives for an annual exam at a clinic. The registration system sends the patient registration information to the local ancillary systems, and the affiliated hospital's ADT system.</p>
      <p>The exam of Alan Alpha reveals a serious condition, and an immediate hospital admission is recommended. Alan Alpha is referred to the affiliated hospital for admission. He is pre-admitted in the hospital for relevant diagnostic tests. The tests confirm the condition, and the patient is admitted in the hospital's ICU. During the stay in the ICU, the patient's insurance is verified, and the updated information is sent from the hospital’s ADT system to the hospital’s ancillary systems.</p>
      <p>After a day in the ICU, Alan Alpha’s condition has improved, and he is transferred to a regular bed. The nurse recording the transfer makes a mistake, and enters the wrong room and bed. After discovering the error, the transfer is canceled, and the correct transfer is recorded. The patient is now recovered and about to leave the hospital. According to the hospital's procedures, he is transferred to an outpatient unit for administering follow-up tests. The patient is registered in the Hospital Outpatient Registration System.</p>
      <p>The outpatient encounter of Alan Alpha is completed; based on satisfactory test results, he is discharged from the hospital and the Outpatient Registration system.</p>
      <p>In this use case, two patient encounter management systems (the hospital ADT system and the hospital Outpatient Registration system) cooperate as peers.</p>

      <p class="note">Note 1: An IHE National Extension shall select at least one of the Merge and Link / Unlink Options, and shall mandate the same option for both the Patient Demographics Supplier and the Patient Demographics Consumer implementations in its realm to ensure interoperability.</p>
      <p class="note">Note 2: The Pending Event Management Option depends on the Inpatient / Outpatient Encounter Management Option. An implementation supporting the Pending Event Management Option must also support the Inpatient / Outpatient Encounter Management Option.</p>
      <p>The PAM Profile offers a large number of options to support the exchange of patient demographic and encounter data in a wide variety of environments. Particularly, this profile addresses both acute care settings and ambulatory healthcare organizations. It is unlikely that one particular environment will need all the options.</p>
      <p>On one hand, an ambulatory care community might need only the pair of actors Patient Demographics Supplier/Patient Demographics Consumer, using transaction [ITI-30]. On the other hand, the exchange of patient demographic and encounter data between a hospital patient administration system and its ancillary systems (laboratory, radiology, cardiology, etc.) might be fully satisfied, for example, with the pair of actors Patient Encounter Supplier/Patient Encounter Consumer, using transaction [ITI-31] with the Basic Subset of messages and the two options “Inpatient/Outpatient Encounter Management” and “Maintain Demographics.”</p>
      <p>Hence, the first decision that must be made by a healthcare organization for the deployment of this profile is to select the proper actors and the appropriate set of options to cover its needs, ensuring that each selected option will be supported by the actors on both ends of the transactions.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as an IT Infrastructure profile, the PAM Profile may not be used standalone. Rather, its actors and transactions will be leveraged by other domain integration profiles (in radiology, cardiology, laboratory, or in cross enterprise document sharing). Here again, the first decision that will be taken by the IHE committee that wishes to leverage PAM for its domain, will be to select the proper set of options and to ascertain the consistent use of these options in its domain.</p>
      <p>Thus, during the building process of IHE domain technical frameworks, as well as in the deployment process, the PAM Profile will be constrained to reduce its original number of options.</p>
      <p>However, to accommodate situations in which a consumer application would not support an option implemented by a supplier application, the PAM Profile requires that the consumer application shall application-reject a message that it does not support (see ITI TF-2: C.2.3).</p>

      <h3 id="14.4.1">14.4.1 Actor Grouping of Patient Encounter Supplier</h3>
      <p>In order to obtain patient identity and demographics information to serve its patient encounter message functions in transaction [ITI-31], a Patient Encounter Supplier is required to be grouped with either a Patient Demographics Supplier or a Patient Demographics Consumer, as shown in Figure 14.4.1-1.</p>
      <p style="font-size:11pt">

        <span style="font-weight:bold">Figure 14.4.1-1: Patient Encounter Supplier Grouping Requirements</span>
      </p>
      <p>On the other hand, transaction [ITI-31] is self-contained in a sense that the Patient Encounter Supplier sends both patient encounter information and patient identity and demographics information (in the context of the encounter data) to the Patient Encounter Consumer. In addition, transaction [ITI-31] also allows the Patient Encounter Supplier to send messages to the Patient Encounter Consumer for patient identity maintenance in the encounter context, including patient update and identity merge. There is no required grouping for the Patient Encounter Consumer.</p>
      <h3 id="14.4.2">14.4.2 Actor Grouping with other IHE Actors</h3>
      <p>The PAM Profile provides an infrastructure in a healthcare enterprise or across a number of enterprises to distribute the patient identity, demographics, and encounter information, in order to enable various clinical functions in clinical settings. The PAM actors can be grouped with actors in other IHE Integration Profiles.</p>
      <p>One possible grouping is between the Patient Demographics Supplier in the PDQ Profile and either the Patient Demographics Supplier or the Patient Demographics Consumer in this profile, to add query support defined in the Patient Demographics Query transaction to the same set of patient information managed in the PAM Profile.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Patient Demographics Supplier in the PDQ Profile can be grouped with the Patient Encounter Supplier of this profile. Due to the required grouping of the Patient Encounter Supplier (see Section 14.4.1), such a grouping can provide query support defined in both the Patient Demographics Query and Patient Demographics and Visit Query transactions to the same set of patient and encounter information that is managed in the PAM Profile.</p>
      <p>These are some examples of possible grouping of the PAM actors with other IHE actors. Many other possibilities may be useful (either to provide additional values or to allow profile structure simplification). For example, in the radiology scheduled workflow (SWF) Profile, the Order Placer and Order Filler Actors can be grouped with the Patient Encounter Consumer Actor.</p>

      <h3 id="14.5.1">14.5.1 Patient Identity Management</h3>
      <p>The Patient Identity Management incorporates the following process flows. This refines the use case shown in ITI TF-1: 14.1.1.</p>
      <h4 id="14.5.1.1">14.5.1.1  Patient Identity Creation and Maintenance</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Create Patient. The Patient Demographics Supplier decides to create a new patient John Smith, based on patient information input from Hospital Sun. At this time, however, there is a limited set of personal information traits of John Smith available. His date of birth, home address, and home phone number, e.g., are unknown. The Patient Demographics Supplier creates the patient identity and sends a Patient Creation message to the Patient Demographics Consumer with the set of known personal information traits.</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Update Patient Demographics. The next day, detailed personal information about John Smith becomes available. The Patient Demographics Supplier updates its patient identity record, and sends out a Patient Update message, including date of birth, home address and home phone number.</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Create Temporary Patient. After a week, the Patient Demographics Supplier creates a temporary patient identity John Doe based on input from Imaging Center Moon.</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Update Patient Demographics and Change Patient Identifiers After reconciliation of the temporary patient, the Patient Demographics Supplier updates John Doe’s demographics to (a new instance of) John Smith, and changes the temporary Patient Identifier originally assigned to a permanent identifier</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Merge Patient Identifiers. After human inspection, it turns out that the two patients named John Smith in the Patient Demographics Supplier actually represent the same real-world patient. The operator decides to merge the two patient identities. The Patient Demographics Supplier sends a Patient Merge message to the Patient Demographics Consumer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following diagram shows the process flow:</p>

      <h3 id="14.5.2">14.5.2 Patient Encounter Management</h3>
      <p>The Patient Encounter Management incorporates the following process flows:</p>
      <h4 id="14.5.2.1">14.5.2.1  Inpatient/Outpatient Encounter, Maintain Demographics, and Pending Event Management</h4>
      <p>In this section, inpatient/outpatient encounter management process flow is described in an environment that involves a number of instances of Patient Encounter Supplier and Patient Encounter Consumer. This refines the use case shown in Section 14.1.2</p>
      <p>In some institutions, there may be one central Patient Encounter Supplier, while others may have multiple Patient Encounter Suppliers serving patient encounter management functions in different clinical settings (e.g., hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, clinics). It is the responsibility of a healthcare institution to define the actor roles of its systems, as well as to configure the relationship of a Patient Encounter Supplier and its Patient Encounter Consumers, to satisfy their business process models.</p>
      <p>As shown in Figure 14.5.2.1-1, in the healthcare institution of this process flow, there are three Patient Encounter Suppliers, each of which serves a number of Patient Encounter Consumers in a specific clinical setting of the institution.</p>
      <div id="f14.5.2.1-1">

        <p class="figureTitle">Figure 14.5.2.1-1: System and PAM Actor Role Configuration</p>
      </div>
      <p>The systems involved in this process flow implement the following PAM roles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Clinic Registration System as Patient Encounter Supplier</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Clinic Ancillary System as Patient Encounter Consumer</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Hospital ADT system as both Patient Encounter Supplier and Patient Encounter Consumer</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Hospital Ancillary system as Patient Encounter Consumer</li>
        <li class="bullet-list1">Hospital Outpatient Registration System as both Patient Encounter Supplier and Patient Encounter Consumer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note that the Hospital ADT and Outpatient Registration Systems play both the roles of Patient Encounter Supplier and Patient Encounter Consumer, and cooperate as peers. The relationship between the Patient Encounter Supplier and Patient Encounter Consumer in the same system is dependent on the clinical application logic implemented in the institution, and the definition of this relationship is beyond the scope of the PAM Integration Profile.</p>
      <p>The process flow in Figure 14.5.2.1-2 is described in the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="bullet-list1">
