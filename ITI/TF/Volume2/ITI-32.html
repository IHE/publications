          <p>This transaction defines the interchange of XDS document submission sets on media. It specifies the
            requirements for a directory structure, and the physical media where stored.</p>
          <p>The file directory structure restrictions and file organization are specified below. These are based on
            industry standard file systems with restrictions chosen based on experience with demonstrated
            interoperability in the field of reliable exchange. These are defined in Part 10 of the DICOM standard and
            summarized below.</p>
          <p>The media that are supported are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-list1"><strong>CD-R media.</strong> The physical media specification used for the storage on CD-R is a
              restricted subset of the widely used CD-R media. The restrictions were chosen to ensure interoperability
              and media reliability. The standard directory and file structure can be recorded to the CD-R media by
              widely available software, but this software must be set to comply with the interoperability restrictions
              on recording format. This media specification relies on the healthcare experience gained by CD-R media
              widely used in radiology and cardiology. It is defined by Annex F in Part 12 of the DICOM standard and is
              also used in the IHE Radiology PDI Profile for the interchange of images,</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1"><strong>USB Removable Devices.</strong> This media specification encompasses a wide range of USB
              connected flash media, removable storage devices, etc. The standard directory and file structure can be
              recorded onto any of these media by any system that supports the USB Removable Device type defined by the
              USB Implementers Forum. This specification is defined in Annex R in Part 12 of the DICOM standard.</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1"><strong>Email transport of ZIP files.</strong> This media specification defines the encoding of the
              directory and file structure as an ordinary ZIP file (maintaining the directory structure) and attaches
              that ZIP file to an email message. Some additional constraints are added to the email message header to
              facilitate recognizing the message. This specification is defined in the annexes to part 12 of the DICOM
              standard called: ZIP File Media and Email media. The ZIP over Email Response Option enables the Portable
              Media Importer to send an acknowledgment message to the Portable Media Importer.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5 id="3.32.4.1.1">3.32.4.1.1 Trigger Events</h5>
          <p>The user at the Portable Media Creator wishes to transport information by the creation and transport of
            interchange media. The Portable Media Creator assembles the Interchange Media content and stores it on the
            media.</p>
          <p>If the ZIP over Email Response Option is supported, the Portable Media Importer shall detect whether the
            Import was successful or not.</p>
          <h5 id="3.32.4.1.2">3.32.4.1.2 Message Semantics</h5>
          <p>The message semantics of this transaction are described in terms of content specifications for the media.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>The Portable Media Creator shall be able to include one or multiple Submission Set(s), including
              document(s) and associated metadata. Additionally, it shall include a</span>
            <span style="font-weight:bold">README.TXT</span>
            <span>file and an</span>
            <span style="font-weight:bold">INDEX.HTM</span>
            <span>and associated files for use to display the media content using a simple browser. It may include other
              files and directories that the Portable Media Importer will ignore.</span>

          <h6 id="3.32.4.1.2.1">3.32.4.1.2.1 Media File system and File Naming Restrictions</h6>
          <p>The following restrictions are needed to ensure broad interoperability:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-list1">Strict ISO 9660 Level 1 compliance for filenames and directories, even on non-CDR
              media.</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1">Strict ISO 9660 Level 1 compliance for recording methods on CDR media. This means
              no packet writing.</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1">Filenames should not be in lower case, nor have lower case equivalent file names
              encoded as Joliet or Rock Ridge extensions to the ISO 9660 file system.</li>
            <li class="bullet-list1">Only file and folder names referenced by the DICOMDIR file are restricted to 8
              characters with no extension. Specifically, it is not permitted to name DICOM files based on their SOP
              Instance UID, since that would exceed the 8 character limit and use the illegal period character, and it
              is not permitted to add a “.dcm” extension or similar.</li>
