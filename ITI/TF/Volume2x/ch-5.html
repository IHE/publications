    <h1 id="Appendix E">Appendix E: Patient Identifiers in HL7-based IHE Profiles</h1>
    <p>
      The Health Level Seven Standard (HL7) uses data type CX to express various identifiers, including the Patient ID in the third field of the PID segment. We discuss here how IHE IT Infrastructure expects the CX data type to be populated in the
      <em>PID-3-Patient Identifier List</em>
      fields of messages that it defines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Requirements for populating the elements of
      <em>PID-3-Patient Identifier List</em>
      vary slightly, depending on what actor is originating the transaction in which the PID segment is sent. If the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager is the source of the PID segment, the requirements (specifically, with respect to populating the Assigning Authority subcomponents) are more rigorous than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>PID-3-Patient Identifier List</em>
      permits multiple occurrences of the CX data type. Data type CX contains 8 components as shown below. This structure allows expression of the value and context for each identifier that the system knows.

      <em>Adapted from the HL7 Standard, Version 2.5</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Each occurrence of
      <em>PID-3-Patient Identifier List</em>
      contains, at a minimum, an identifier value in Component 1 and an assigning authority in Component 4. The assigning authority unambiguously provides the context for the identifier. It is also common practice to provide an identifier type code in Component 5, but this is not required by IHE in the context of the PIX transactions [ITI-8], [ITI-9], and [ITI-10]. Other components are optional and will not be discussed here; implementers may refer to HL7 Version 2.5 for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Component 1 of Data Type CX, ID, is of data type ST. This data type allows a free text value of up to 15 characters.
      <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref">
        <sup>4</sup>
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>Component 4 of Data Type CX, Assigning Authority, is of data type HD. This data type contains 3 components that, when implemented at the component level, become subcomponents of Component 4. The requirements for the subcomponents of Component 4 vary by actor.</p>
    <h2 id="Appendix E.1">E.1 Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager Actor Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      The Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager is expected to have access to complete internal and external identifier information for the Assigning Authority of the patient identifier. To facilitate interoperability, it is required that the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager populate
      <span class="underline">all</span>
      subcomponents of the Assigning Authority component. The usage of these subcomponents will be explained in the examples below.
    </p>
    <p>This requirement applies to the response portion of the PIX Query [ITI-9] and PIX Update Notification [ITI-10] transactions.</p>

    <p>IHE specifies that the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager must populate all 3 subcomponents of Component 4. The following rules apply:</p>
    <p>
      Subcomponent 1 of Component 4, Namespace ID, is of data type IS. HL7 specifies that when valued in the Patient ID field, the value in this subcomponent be a code taken from user-defined Table 0363,
      <em>Assigning Authority</em>
      . Version 2.5 of HL7 provides suggested values for assigning authorities in various local jurisdictions, such as USSSA for U.S. Social Security Administration. Sites may add values to this table, but for interoperability must ensure that added values (and meanings) are agreed upon by all communicating systems.
    </p>
    <p>Subcomponent 2 of Component 4, Universal ID, is of data type ST. This subcomponent contains a value from either a known external domain or a specified internal domain. The domain is given in Subcomponent 3.</p>
    <p>
      Subcomponent 3, Universal ID Type, is of data type ID. This subcomponent contains a code taken from HL7 Table 0301,
      <em>Universal ID Type</em>
      . Table 0301 contains values for various known external identifier domains such as DNS (Internet dotted name) and ISO (International Standards Organization Object Identifier, or OID), as well as the values L, M, and N to permit the use of internal identifier domains.
    </p>
    <p>Subcomponent 1 must refer to the same entity as Subcomponents 2 and 3.</p>
    <h3 id="Appendix E.1.1">E.1.1 Other actor requirements</h3>
    <p>The PID segment may also appear in messages generated by other IHE actors, including the Patient ID Cross-reference Consumer and the Information Source. These actors must also populate the Assigning Authority.</p>
    <p>However, IHE specifies that they need not populate all three subcomponents of Assigning Authority. They must populate either Namespace ID (an entry from a user-defined table), or Universal ID and Universal ID Type (allowing the use of an externally defined identifier scheme).</p>
    <p>This requirement applies to the Patient Identity Feed [ITI-8] transaction and to the query portion of PIX Query [ITI-9]. This requirement does not apply to the response portion of [ITI-9] nor to PIX Update Notification [ITI-10].</p>

    <h2 id="Appendix E.2">E.2 HL7 V3 II Data Type</h2>
    <p>The Health Level Seven Standard Version 3 (HL7 V3) uses data type II to express an identifier that uniquely identifies a thing or object (see HL7 Version 3 Standard Data Types), including medical record number or other patient identifiers. We discuss here how IHE IT Infrastructure profiles the use of II data type to express patient identifiers in HL7 V3 messages and HL7 V3 CDA Document Templates defined or referenced in this Technical Framework. In the following text of this section, all requirements for the II data type are specified solely in the context of patient identifier expression.</p>
    <p>Since IHE adds additional constraints to the II data type, requirements for populating its elements vary slightly, depending on what actor is originating a transaction (or create a CDA document), in which Patient ID is expressed. If the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager is the source of the Patient ID in a message, the requirements (specifically, with respect to populating the assigningAuthorityName elements) are more rigorous than otherwise.</p>
    <p>The IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework adds constraints to the II data type for Patient ID expression in HL7 V3 messages or CDA documents, in order to maintain compatibility with the explicit relationship between a Patient ID Domain (assigning authority) and a Patient ID issued in the Domain present in the HL7 V2 CX data type. In HL7 V2 messages defined in the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework, Patient ID is expressed in the form of an identifier value (CX.ID) issued in a domain (CX.AssigningAuthority) (see Section E.1). Even though HL7 V3 provides additional mechanisms for an explicit expression of the key concept of Patient ID Domain (via scoping organizations), the constraints added to the II data type in this section enable a seamless interoperability among HL7 V2 messages, HL7 V3 messages, as well as CDA documents, which may participate in the same IT Infrastructure Profile.</p>
    <p>At the same time, it is also important to represent the RIM-based association between assigning authority and patient identifiers, which is expected by systems using the rich semantics of the RIM. In order to achieve that IHE imposes several constraints regarding patient IDs on the HL7 V3 models used in IHE transactions:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Identifiers for the patient are class attributes of a specific role, and never of the Person class of the patient.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When the Patient role is scoped by a Provider organization, only patient IDs assigned by the provider organization are allowed in the Patient class, the root element of the patient IDs shall match the root element of the provider organization ID, and the provider organization ID shall have no extension element.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When any other role associated with the Person class of the patient is scoped by an organization, the root element of the role IDs shall match the root element of the scoping organization ID, and the scoping organization ID shall have no extension element.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A receiver of an HL7 v3 message shall consider the IDs in all roles associated with the Person class of the patient as valid patient IDs.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A receiver of an HL7 v3 message shall not be required to maintain the various roles associated with the Person class of the patient, as long as, when becoming a sender, it can appropriately send all relevant patient IDs according to the requirements of a particular transaction.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="Appendix E.2.1">E.2.1 Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager requirements</h3>
    <p>The Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager is expected to have access to complete information for a Patient ID value and its issuing Patient ID Domain (assigning authority).

    <p>IHE specifies that the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager must populate both elements root and extension for Patient ID Domain and Patient ID value, respectively, and element root must be an ISO OID. If the same patient identifier is populated in a HL7 V2 message, element root and extension shall correspond to CX.4.2 and CX.1, respectively, and CX.4.3 shall be ISO (see Section E.1).</p>
    <p>
      In addition, IHE requires that the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager populates element assigningAuthorityName. Though there is no additional requirement for the data type of this element than a text string in a HL7 V3 message or CDA document, it shall be the same value as populated in CX.4.1, if the actor participates in transactions of both HL7 V3 and HL7 V2 messages. In this case, element assigningAuthorityName shall contain a value of HL7 V2 data type IS, a code taken from user-defined Table 0363, Assigning Authority
