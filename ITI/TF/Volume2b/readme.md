This folder holds each transaction in Volume 2 as independently addressable pages. There may be other content here to support such as images. 

Thus each Transaction will be represented here as <transaction identity>.html (i.e. ITI-18.html), and possibly a redirect for <transaction name>.html

Each Volume 2 appendix will also be addressible here.

Links in this content will only address Volume 2 appendix or Volume 3 metadata

index.html in this folder will itemize the content much like the table-of-content supports Volume today
