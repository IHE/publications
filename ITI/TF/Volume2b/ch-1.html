    <h1 id="1">1 Introduction</h1>
    <p>This document, Volume 2 of the IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Technical Framework, defines transactions used in IHE IT Infrastructure profiles.</p>
    <h2 id="1.29">1.29 Introduction to IHE</h2>
    <p>Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) is an international initiative to promote the use of standards to achieve interoperability among health information technology (HIT) systems and effective use of electronic health records (EHRs). IHE provides a forum for care providers, HIT experts and other stakeholders in several clinical and operational domains to reach consensus on standards-based solutions to critical interoperability issues.</p>
    <p>The primary output of IHE is system implementation guides, called IHE Profiles. IHE publishes each profile through a well-defined process of public review and trial implementation and gathers profiles that have reached final text status into an IHE Technical Framework, of which this volume is a part.</p>
    <p>

    <h2 id="1.30">1.30 Introduction to IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Technical Framework</h2>
    <p>
      This document, the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework (ITI TF), defines specific implementations of established standards to achieve integration goals that promote appropriate sharing of medical information to support optimal patient care. It is expanded annually, after a period of public review, and maintained regularly through the identification and correction of errata. The latest version of the document is always available at

    <p>The remainder of Section 1 further describes the general nature, purpose and function of the Technical Framework. Section 2 presents the conventions used in this volume to define IHE transactions.</p>
    <p>Section 3 defines transactions in detail, specifying the roles for each actor, the standards employed, the information exchanged, and in some cases, implementation options for the transaction. Section 3 is divided into two parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Volume 2a: Sections 3.1 - 3.28 corresponding to transactions [ITI-1] through [ITI-28].</p>
