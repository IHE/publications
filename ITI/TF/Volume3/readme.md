This folder holds content of Volume 3 as independently addressable pages. There may be other content here to support such as images. 

The XDS metadata will be broken up into header level 4 addressible sections, so as to be useful - See the XDS Wiki page as example https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Cross-Enterprise_Document_Sharing#Vol._3 . As in DocumentEntry.html, where each attribute would be # addressible - DocumentEntry.html#creationTime

Each Content Profile will be represented here as <Content Profile Name>.html.

No links from this content elsewhere

index.html in this folder will itemize the content much like the table-of-content supports Volume today
