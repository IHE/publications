      <h1 id="1">1 Introduction</h1>
      <p>This document, Volume 4, of the IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Technical Framework describes the country-specific extensions to ITI transactions and content modules.</p>
      <h2 id="1.1">1.1 Introduction to IHE</h2>
      <p>Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) is an international initiative to promote the use of standards to achieve interoperability among health information technology (HIT) systems and effective use of electronic health records (EHRs). IHE provides a forum for care providers, HIT experts and other stakeholders in several clinical and operational domains to reach consensus on standards-based solutions to critical interoperability issues.</p>
      <p>The primary output of IHE is system implementation guides, called IHE Profiles. IHE publishes each profile through a well-defined process of public review and trial implementation and gathers profiles that have reached final text status into an IHE Technical Framework, of which this volume is a part.</p>
      <p>
