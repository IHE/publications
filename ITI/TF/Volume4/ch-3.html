      <p>The national extensions documented in this section shall be used in conjunction with the definitions of integration profiles, actors and transactions provided in Volumes 1 through 3 of the IHE ITI Technical Framework. This section includes extensions and restrictions to effectively support the regional practice of healthcare in the United States.</p>
      <p>This ITI national extension document was authored under the sponsorship and supervision of IHE USA and the IT Infrastructure Technical Committee. Comments should be directed to: </p>

      <h2 id="3.1">3.1 Data Segmentation for Privacy (DS4P)</h2>
      <p>This National Extension shows how to use and interpret the Document Sharing Metadata Profiles (XDS.b, XCA, XDR, XDM, and MHD) in compliance with the requirements identified for Data Segmentation for Privacy (DS4P). Data Segmentation is the privacy and security concept for differentiating between data that are to be handled differently for privacy or security reasons. Data Segmentation for Privacy support in this context is the interoperability constraints to enable documents of various and different privacy and sensitivity to be communicated within a trust framework in a way that the sender can communicate necessary and specific privacy and security attributes and obligations in a way that the recipient can clearly understand them and act properly.</p>
      <p>This national extension is intended to be used within a trust framework between communicating parties. This trust framework includes policy agreements to use this national extension to communicate segmented sensitive information. For each document that is communicated within this trust framework (PUSH or PULL) the following metadata constraints shall be used to communicate the highest sensitivity of the content as evaluated by the sender. The identified sensitivity level is then enforced by the recipient. Trust enforcement is expected to be defined and managed within that trust framework.</p>
      <p>This USA National Extension addresses methods for sharing of segmented documents containing personally identifiable information (PII) as may be permitted by privacy policies or regulations. The privacy policies on which this National Extension is based do not explicitly address the clinical implications of giving patients control over the disclosure of their sensitive records. Standards development organizations are focused on the development of technical infrastructure specifications and remain agnostic on the appropriateness of a privacy policy.</p>
      <p>Privacy policies are defined as limits on disclosure and use. Disclosure and use restrictions may originate from a patient, a service provider, or from jurisdictions where healthcare is delivered. Implementations should be prepared to extend functionality based on state, region, and local policies.</p>
      <p>
        <span>This USA National Extension is the result of a proposal from the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) to develop guidance for implementation of Data Segmentation Techniques, including RESTful patterns as defined in the MHD Profile, using the standards, building blocks and principles documented in the Use Cases developed by the S&amp;I DS4P stakeholder community, and the</span>

        <span>  Furthermore, this specification draws upon and cites specific instances of U.S. law such as 42 CFR Part 2, 38 CFR Part 1, etc. These specific references are intended to profile a specific set of users operating under realm specific law and goals. Nothing in this supplement is intended to prevent adoption or customization to meet the needs of other realms.</span>
