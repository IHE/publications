    <h1 id="2">2 Conventions</h1>
    <p>This document has adopted the following conventions for representing the framework concepts and specifying how the standards upon which the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework is based should be applied.</p>
    <h2 id="2.1">2.1 The Generic IHE Transaction Model</h2>
    <p>Transaction descriptions are provided in Section 3. In each transaction description, the actors, the roles they play, and the transactions between them are presented as use cases.</p>
    <p>The generic IHE transaction description includes the following components:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Scope: a brief description of the transaction.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use case roles: textual definitions of the actors and their roles, with a simple diagram relating them, e.g.,:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Referenced Standards</em>
          : the standards (stating the specific parts, chapters or sections thereof) to be used for the transaction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Interaction Diagram</em>
          : a graphical depiction of the actors and messages that support the transaction, with related processing within an actor shown as a rectangle and time progressing downward, similar to:
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The interaction diagrams used in the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework are modeled after those described in Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson,
      <em>The Unified Modeling Language User Guide</em>
      , ISBN 0-201-57168-4. Simple acknowledgment messages are often omitted from the diagrams for brevity. One or more messages may be required to satisfy a transaction. Each message is represented as an arrow starting from the actor initiating the message.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <em>Message definitions</em>
          : descriptions of each message involved in the transaction, the events that trigger the message, its semantics, and the actions that the message triggers in the receiver.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="2.2">2.2 HL7 Profiling Conventions</h2>
    <p>See <a href="../Volume2x/ch-3.html#Appendix C">ITI TF-2x: Appendix C</a> for the HL7 profiling conventions as well as the networking implementation guidelines.</p>
    <h2 id="2.3">2.3 Use of Coded Entities and Coding Schemes</h2>
    <p>
      IHE does not produce, maintain or otherwise specify a coding scheme or other resource for controlled terminology (coded entities). Where applicable, coding schemes required by the HL7 and DICOM
      <sup>®</sup>
      <a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref">
        <sup>2</sup>
      </a>
      standards take precedence. In the cases where such resources are not explicitly identified by standards, implementations may utilize any resource (including proprietary or local) provided any licensing/copyright requirements are satisfied.
