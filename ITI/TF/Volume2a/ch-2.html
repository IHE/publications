    <h1 xmlns="" id="2">2 Conventions</h1>
    <p xmlns="">This document has adopted the following conventions for representing the framework concepts and specifying how the standards upon which the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework is based should be applied.</p>
    <h2 xmlns="" id="2.1">2.1 The Generic IHE Transaction Model</h2>
    <p xmlns="">Transaction descriptions are provided in Section 3. In each transaction description, the actors, the roles they play, and the transactions between them are presented as use cases.</p>
    <p xmlns="">The generic IHE transaction description includes the following components:</p>
    <ul xmlns="">
      <li class="bullet-list1">Scope: a brief description of the transaction.</li>
      <li class="bullet-list1">Use case roles: textual definitions of the actors and their roles, with a simple diagram relating them, e.g.,:</li>
    </ul>
    <img xmlns="" src="media/alql6-rgeyz.002.png" width="319" height="211" alt="" />
    <ul xmlns="">
      <li class="bullet-list1">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Referenced Standards</span>
        <span>: the standards (stating the specific parts, chapters or sections thereof) to be used for the transaction.</span>
      </li>
      <li class="bullet-list1">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Interaction Diagram</span>
        <span>: a graphical depiction of the actors and messages that support the transaction, with related processing within an actor shown as a rectangle and time progressing downward, similar to:</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <img xmlns="" src="media/alql6-rgeyz.003.png" width="308" height="232" alt="" />
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The interaction diagrams used in the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework are modeled after those described in Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson,</span>
      <span style="font-style:italic">The Unified Modeling Language User Guide</span>
      <span>, ISBN 0-201-57168-4. Simple acknowledgment messages are often omitted from the diagrams for brevity. One or more messages may be required to satisfy a transaction. Each message is represented as an arrow starting from the actor initiating the message.</span>
    </p>
    <ul xmlns="">
      <li class="bullet-list1">
        <span style="font-style:italic">Message definitions</span>
        <span>: descriptions of each message involved in the transaction, the events that trigger the message, its semantics, and the actions that the message triggers in the receiver.</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 xmlns="" id="2.2">2.2 HL7 Profiling Conventions</h2>
    <p xmlns="">See <a href="../Volume2x/ch-3.html#Appendix C">ITI TF-2x: Appendix C</a> for the HL7 profiling conventions as well as the networking implementation guidelines.</p>
    <h2 xmlns="" id="2.3">2.3 Use of Coded Entities and Coding Schemes</h2>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>IHE does not produce, maintain or otherwise specify a coding scheme or other resource for controlled terminology (coded entities). Where applicable, coding schemes required by the HL7 and DICOM</span>
      <span style="font-size:8pt;vertical-align:super">®</span>
      <a href="#_ftn2" style="text-decoration:none">
        <span style="font-size:8pt;vertical-align:super">[2]</span>
      </a>
      <span>standards take precedence. In the cases where such resources are not explicitly identified by standards, implementations may utilize any resource (including proprietary or local) provided any licensing/copyright requirements are satisfied.</span>
