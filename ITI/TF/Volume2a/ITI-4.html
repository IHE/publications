    <h4 xmlns="" id="3.4.4.1">3.4.4.1    Kerberized Communications</h4>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The sequence diagram above describes information flow that can be encapsulated in a variety of different protocol startup sequences. The specific details for this encapsulation are defined as part of the definition of Kerberizing a specific kind of communication protocol.</span>
    </p>
    <h5 xmlns="" id="3.4.4.1.1">3.4.4.1.1   Trigger Events</h5>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>This occurs at the beginning of a session or as part of each session-less transaction.</span>
    </p>
    <h5 xmlns="" id="3.4.4.1.2">3.4.4.1.2   Message Semantics</h5>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The Client Authentication Agent requests service from a Kerberized Server by sending the server a Kerberos Application Request (KRB_AP_REQ). This message contains an authenticator encrypted with the session key, the ticket obtained in the Get Service Ticket Transaction, and a flag indicating whether the client wants mutual authentication. (The setting of this flag is either specified by the rules of the Kerberized communications, or is an option of the specific Kerberized protocol.)</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The Kerberized Server receives KRB_AP_REQ, decrypts the ticket, and extracts the authorization data and the session key. The server uses the session key to decrypt the authenticator and then evaluates the timestamp inside. If the authenticator passes the test, the server looks for a mutual authentication flag in the client’s request for protocols that support mutual authentication. If the flag is set, the server uses the session key to encrypt the time supplied by the Client Authentication and returns the result in a Kerberos Application Reply (KRB_AP_REP).</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The actual encoding and exchange of the KRB_AP_REQ and KRB_AP_REP are defined as part of the definition of the specific Kerberized protocol.</span>
    </p>
    <h5 xmlns="" id="3.4.4.1.3">3.4.4.1.3   Expected Actions</h5>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>When the Client Authentication receives KRB_AP_REP, it decrypts the server’s authenticator with the session key it shares with the server and compares the time returned by the service with the time in the client’s original authenticator. If the times match, the client knows that the service is genuine, and the connection proceeds.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>If no mutual authentication is requested, the other IHE actors proceed with their IHE transactions. These transactions are identified as being requested by the authenticated user. The other actors will utilize this information for other purposes, such as confirming user authorization or logging user actions into audit trails.</span>

      <span style="width:13.75pt; text-indent:0pt; display:inline-block"> </span>
      <span>At the time of publication there were no Kerberized HTTP normative standards. There are three relatively well-documented non-normative specifications. In addition, there are commercial and open source implementations of this specification for web and application servers. It was decided to use the Kerberized HTTP specification that is implemented by Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) because many healthcare desktops use MSIE.</span>
