    <p xmlns="">
      <span>In the Authenticate Node transaction, the local Secure Node presents its identity to a remote Secure Node, and authenticates the identity of the remote node. After this mutual</span>
      <span>authentication,</span>
      <span>other secure transactions may take place through this secure pipe between the two nodes.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>In addition, the Secure Node authenticates the identity of the user who requests access to the node. This user authentication is a local operation that does not involve communication with a remote node.</span>

The secure node shall not allow access to PHI to an operator who has not successfully completed the local user authentication. Local user authentication is not an IHE specified network transaction, although it may utilize a network system for user authentication.</span>

      <span>The rules for assignment of unique individual identities to users is part of the Security Policy of the healthcare enterprise. Development of these rules is outside the scope of the IHE Technical Framework. The following examples list a few special cases related to user identification that may occur in practice.</span>
    </p>
    <h4 xmlns="" id="3.19.7.1">3.19.7.1 Example: Team approach</h4>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>When the operator is part of a team performing a procedure, the other members of the team involved in creating and accessing the data should be manually identified and recorded in the procedure log (which may be paper or electronic), and it is assumed that all have accessed the data even though they were not (and cannot be in most cases) actually logged on to the piece of equipment.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>During some procedures, it may be necessary for one operator to relieve the operator who has already been authenticated by the system. It is recommended that the first operator log off and that the system authenticate the new operator.</span>
    </p>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The audit log supports identification of the active participant. This is often defined as one key member of the team. Other means are used to track the entry and exit of various members of the team. IHE does not specify any specific team identification process.</span>
    </p>
    <h4 xmlns="" id="3.19.7.2">3.19.7.2 Example: Access to locked exam room, no user logon on modality.</h4>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>There may be situations where the acquisition modality has no user logon features, and access to the equipment is controlled by controlling access to the examination room. In these situations an equipment-specific user ID will be used, and access to the room should be recorded in the procedure log (which may be paper or electronic).</span>
    </p>
    <h4 xmlns="" id="3.19.7.3">3.19.7.3 Example: Enterprise User Authentication</h4>
    <p xmlns="">
      <span>The healthcare enterprise may implement local user authentication using the Enterprise User Authentication Profile (EUA). This implementation may be mixed with other non-EUA access to the secure domain, based upon each node’s internal use an EUA availability.</span>
