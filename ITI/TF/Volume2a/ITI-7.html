    <h2 id="3.7">3.7 Leave Context [ITI-7]</h2>
    <p>This section corresponds to transaction [ITI-7] of the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework. Transaction [ITI-7] is used by the Patient Context Participant, User Context Participant, Client Authentication Agent, and Context Manager Actors.</p>
    <h3 id="3.7.1">3.7.1 Scope</h3>
    <p>This transaction allows for an application supporting the Patient Context Participant, User Context Participant, or Client Authentication Agent to terminate participation in a context management session in which it is participating.</p>
    <p>
      A Context Participant notifies the Context Manager that is leaving the common context. The semantics of the methods used are defined in the documents
      <em>HL7 Context Management “CCOW” Standard: Component Technology Mapping: ActiveX</em>
      or
      <em>HL7 Context Management “CCOW” Standard: Component Technology Mapping: Web</em>
      . The Context Participant can choose the technology implementation it wishes to implement. The Context Manager must support both technology implementations in order to accommodate whichever implementation a joining participant ends up choosing.
    </p>

    <p>Actor: Patient Context Participant</p>
    <p>Role: Initiates notification to the Context Manager that it will no longer be participating in the context management session.</p>
    <p>Actor: User Context Participant</p>

    <p>LeaveContext is defined as a method on the ContextManager interface. It shall be invoked by a Context Participant to announce its departure from the secure context session. A Context Participant shall provide parameters for this method as specified in the CCOW Standard.</p>
    <p>
      Refer to the
      <em>HL7 Context Management “CCOW” Standard: Technology and Subject-Independent Architecture</em>
      document, Section 17.3.6.4, for a description of the parameters associated with this method.
