<h1 id="introduction-to-this-supplement">Introduction to this Supplement</h1>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<p>This profile is motivated by customer requirements for authorizing network transactions, when using HTTP RESTful transports. IHE has authorization profiles for the Web Services and SOAP based transactions. This profile provides an authorization profile for the HTTP RESTful transactions.</p>
<p>Being authorized means that the user, patient or provider, has legitimate access to this HTTP RESTful service. The authorization includes identifying the user and the application that is making the request to the HTTP RESTful server, so that server can make further access control decisions.</p>
<p>The HTTP RESTful transport is being used by many healthcare applications and smart devices. These share a common set of issues. A typical use case example is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The patient has a tablet and installs an application onto that tablet.</p></li>
<li><p>An application will need to retrieve and update health related data that is stored on a Resource Server. It uses HTTP RESTful transactions for both retrieve and update because HTTP support is integrated into the platform services.</p></li>
<li><p>Patients want to configure the application to have access to their data without needing the IT staff at the application vendor and resource vendor to set things up.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The HTTP RESTful services may include user driven browser activity, downloaded applications, and automatic devices. The existing IHE ITI XUA Profile fills these needs for the SOAP transport based transactions. The existing IHE ITI EUA Profile fills these needs for various different transports within a single enterprise environment, including HTTP RESTful transports.</p>
<p>The Basic Patient Privacy Consent (BPPC) Profile is associated with this profile and these other existing profile. BPPC covers the legal and administrative needs for consent documentation and associating the patient consent with policy documentation. The BPPC profile includes the ability to associate the electronic authorizations with the patient agreements and organizational policies.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that IUA is not a substitute for the administrative activities (such as withdrawing consent), policy setting, and other activities that BPPC documents provide. Greater integration of this authorization with third party authorization and consent documentation profiles, such as those found in the IHE BPPC Profile, are a future effort. This profile starts with just the basic authorization activities.</p>
<p>The administrative actions needed to establish an Authorization Server for IUA is not covered by these profile. These activities depend upon the operational needs, organizational and privacy policies that apply to a particular deployment.</p>
<h3 id="background-on-the-problem-environment">Background on the problem environment</h3>
<p>The application interacts with both patient and Authorization Server to support the granting of an access token. The application then uses the access token to retrieve and update health related data.</p>
<p>The key issues here are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reliable and accurate authorization decisions, as part of an overall privacy protecting and security environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Application developers expect one common method for obtaining and using access tokens.</p></li>
<li><p>Resource Servers expect one common method for receiving access tokens as part of HTTP RESTful transactions, and one common method for processing these tokens.</p></li>
<li><p>Users, patients and providers, expect to be in control, do not want to depend on support staff to set up their applications, and want to minimize the interference from authorization requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Similar issues arise with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In house application distribution that needs authorization for applications used within the facility.</p></li>
<li><p>IT administrators prefer a common method to authorize use of in house web applications and access to in house resources.</p></li>
<li><p>Providers and Specialists have authorization needs for dealing with other organizations and need to deal with many resource services.</p></li>
<li><p>Granting subset access to specialized provider. E.g., read access to cardiac info to physical therapy organization, forbidding access to other sensitive health data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also environmental assumptions made by this profile.</p>
<p>First, it is assumed that there will many systems working together to build the access control environment, where IUA provides one part only. For example, a glucose monitor may be authorized to have access to a patient's medical record. The expectation is that this will mean access to all of the glucose related information, which will include a variety of measurements and prescriptions. But, it is expected that if the device requests other sensitive health data about it will be rejected.</p>
<p>Second, this profile is operating in an environment where access consents are managed by BPPC or other mechanisms. IUA is not a substitute for documenting, establishing, and modifying these legal agreements. For example, there will be a documented consent agreement between a patient and a provider that the provider will provide medical records to a healthcare proxy that is identified and authorized by the patient. BPPC is one way to document that agreement.</p>
<h1 id="open-issues-and-question">Open Issues and Question</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Issue 11</strong>: IUA does not define scopes at all, therefore IUA is not in conflict with SMART-on-FHIR. However this supplement includes updates to MHD and does define a Scope for use with MHD transactions. This definition today does not use SMART pattern, but does not forbid SMART scopes too. IHE requests comments on the IUA, MHD, and SMART-on-FHIR scope harmonization.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Issue 12</strong>: Given that the IUA Resource Server is grouped with some other IHE defined actor, and that actor has audit logging requirements; IUA does not need to give a defined audit event for success. IUA does impose adding an AuditEvent.entity to that audit even defined in the other profile. But this should be explained well enough for the reader to understand already. IHE requests comments on a need to define in IUA an AuditEvent specific to a Resource Server that is enforcing a DENY. This AuditEvent would be used when the Resource Server prevented the transaction from reaching the grouped Profile (e.g. MHD Document Responder). This AuditEvent would cover reasons for DENY that are thus not specific to the content of the grouped transaction. Reasons such as: Missing Token, Token validation failure, Token expiration, Scope mismatch, IUA required attributes missing, etc. The expectation is that we can leverage some codes from OAuth.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="closed-issues">Closed Issues</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Issue 1</strong>: At this time, the method for assignment of client identifiers is not included in the profile. Registration of clients is a significant operational and security problem that is being postponed until there is more experience with problems in the field and reasonable solutions. In the field there are a variety of methods being tried. Many depend upon physical distribution methods or out of band communications to manage the authentication problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Issue 2</strong>: This profile does support access token in JWT format and SAML 2.0 Assertions compliant with the XUA profile requirements. An operational environment must ensure, that access tokens are understood by the authorization and Resource Servers. The Bearer Token option of earlier versions of the profile has been removed, since it does not specify the access token format and attributes used and was thus not interoperable by design.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Issue 3</strong>: Audit messages are only defined for clients that are also Secure Applications. There is no defined auditing for other clients.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Issue 4</strong>: This profile does not require client grouping with Secure Node or Secure Application because it is using the OAuth client authentication methods. It assumes that the client authentication method will deal with security considerations in a manner similar to the certificate management assumptions made for TLS and other certificate users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Issue 8</strong>: This profile uses the Authorization header only for conveying the authorization information. The parameter form is not prohibited but is not compliant with the profile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Issue 9</strong>: This profile does not explain the ways that some Resource Servers utilize HTTP redirects to automate some kinds of authorization activities. The actual HTTP transactions used for Obtain Authorization Token and Authorized RESTful Transaction are as defined within this profile. The other transactions are under the control of the Resource Server and its design.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Issue 10</strong>: The selected standards are: The OAuth 2.1 Framework, JWT Token, with defined extensions, SAML Token, using the XUA extensions. |</p></li>

<h1 id="34-iua-profile">34 IUA Profile</h1>
<p>The IUA Profile adds authorization information to HTTP RESTful transactions. The IUA actors and behavior will be added to other profiles and transactions that need authorization.</p>
<h2 id="341-iua-actors-transactions-and-content-modules">34.1 IUA Actors, Transactions, and Content Modules</h2>
<p>The actors in the IUA Profile manage the tokens used for authorization of access to HTTP RESTful services based on the flows and transactions defined in the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework [OAuth 2.1]. Authorization Clients interact with the Authorization Server to retrieve access tokens and incorporate them into HTTP RESTful transactions to authorize access to resources on the Resource Servers.</p>
<p>The OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework requires client identification, which may be based on a <em>client_id</em> parameter [OAuth 2.1, Section 2.2]. Depending on the grant type, the use of the <em>client_id</em> MAY be required. For example the <em>Authorization Code</em> grant type requires the use of the <em>client_id</em> for client identification [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.1], while the <em>Client Credential</em> grant type does not [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.2].</p>
<p>The OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework also requires client authentication for confidential and credential clients [OAuth 2.1, Section 2.3]. It recommends the use of to use asymmetric (public-key based) methods for client authentication [OAuth 2.1, Section 9.1], but allows other suitable HTTP based authentication schemes matching the security policy of the Authorization Server [OAuth 2.1, Section 2.3.2].</p>
<p>This profile requires the use of a <em>client_id</em> for client identification and a <em>client_secret</em> used with the HTTP Basic Authentication scheme for client authentication of confidential and credentialed clients, if no other methods for identification and authentication are used.</p>
<p>Depending on the grant type, the OAuth 2.1 Framework also requires user authentication. For example, the <em>Authorization Code</em> grant type covered by this profile requires user authentication [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.1], while the <em>Client Credential</em> grant type does not [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.2]. The methods used by the Authorization Server to authenticate the user (e.g., username and password login, session cookies, delegation to Authentication Server) is not scoped in the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework [OAuth 2.1, Section 3.1].</p>
<p>Since user authentication methods chosen depend on the projects or national security policy, they are not scoped in this profile and SHALL be defined in the specific implementation projects or national extensions of this profile. If the user authentication is not implemented in the Authorization Server, the use of OpenID Connect with the Authorization Grant or Hybrid flow is recommended.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the Resource Server to enforce the access policies based on the transaction performed and the information provided in the access token. Therefore the Resource Server MUST be able to rely upon the decisions made by the Authorization Server (e.g., client identification, user authentication), which requires that a trust relation between the Resource Server and the Authorization Server was established beforehand.</p>
<p>The Resource Server MAY delegate the access policy enforcement to actors it is grouped with by providing the information from the access token and transaction data, or to other actors (e.g., by implementing the Authorization Decisions Verifier actor of the Secure Retrieve (SeR) supplement).</p>
<p>Note: An analogy of the segregation of duties for access control between the Authorization Server and the Resource Server is given in a textbook (<em>Solving Identity Management in Modern Applications</em>, <em>APress 2019</em> by Yvonne Wilson and Abhishek Hingnikar) comparing the authorization and policy enforcement with a ticketing and entrance control to events (e.g, opera, cinema). In this analogy the Authorization Server provides the ticket which authorizes participation, while additional checks are performed to finally participate to the event.</p>
<p>This profile relies on the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework. Since the original publication of OAuth 2.0 in 2012, several new RFCs have been published that add or remove functionality from the core specification. Version 2.1 of the OAuth Authorization Framework consolidates and simplifies the most commonly used features and best practices of OAuth 2.0.</p>

<h3 id="3411-actor-descriptions-and-actor-profile-requirements">34.1.1 Actor Descriptions and Actor Profile Requirements</h3>
<p>The IUA actors are expected to be grouped with other actors that perform HTTP RESTful transactions. Grouping an Authorization Client with another actor means that this other actor will provide an access token as part of the HTTP transaction to a HTTP RESTful server. It MAY perform the Get Authorization Token transaction to obtain the access token. The corresponding HTTP RESTful server SHOULD be grouped with the Resource Server actor to indicate that the server can perform access control.</p>
<h4 id="34111-authorization-client">34.1.1.1 Authorization Client</h4>
<p>The Authorization Client performs the network transactions and user interactions needed to obtain an access token and to attach that token to transactions to indicate that the transactions are authorized. An Authorization Client in IUA supports the following associated transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get Authorization Server Metadata: In this case the Authorization Client interacts with the Authorization Server to obtain configuration metadata required for the further authorization steps such as Authorization endpoint locations and supported authorization grant types.</p></li>
<li><p>Get Authorization Token: In this case, the Authorization Client interacts with an Authorization Server to obtain a token that indicates HTTP RESTful transactions for a particular kind of service and device are authorized by the user. This MAY include interactions with the user for authentication purposes.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate Authorization Token: In this case the access token has already been obtained and is communicated as part of the HTTP RESTful transaction for some other profile or service. With this token the Authorization Client indicates that the HTTP RESTful transaction has been authorized by the Authorization Server. The Resource Server will validate the client's token with associated claims and enforce configured access policies before serving the request.</p></li>
<li><p>When the Incorporate Authorization Token is to be used with a FHIR server, an Authorization Client SHOULD query the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities">capabilities</a> endpoint on the Resource Server to determine if the Resource Server supports IUA. The element <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/capabilitystatement.html"><strong>CapabilityStatement.rest.security.service</strong></a> will be populated with the code "IUA" at system canonical URL "<a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/fhir/ihe.securityTypes/CodeSystem/securityTypes">http://profiles.ihe.net/fhir/ihe.securityTypes/CodeSystem/securityTypes</a>".</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="34112-authorization-server">34.1.1.2 Authorization Server</h4>
<p>The Authorization Server provides access tokens to requesting clients. In IUA, the Authorization Server uses an authenticated user identity, the requested HTTP RESTful service URL to the Resource Server, and/or other information to determine whether HTTP RESTful transactions are authorized. If authorized, the Authorization Server provides an access token which authorizes the client to retrieve data and documents from the Resource Server.</p>
<p>Authorization Servers declaring the Authorization Server Metadata option SHALL provide a metadata endpoint that provides configuration information to Authorization Client and Resource Servers. This information includes endpoint locations, supported authentication grants and signing key materials. This information greatly simplifies the configuration of those Authorization Clients and Resource Servers.</p>
<p>Authorization Servers declaring the Token Introspection option SHALL provide an endpoint usable by Resource Servers to validate and evaluate the access token. With this option, the Authorization Server MAY provide other token formats than JWT or SAML. Using this option, the token can be treated as an opaque data construct for Resource Servers. When Token Introspection option is used the Authorization Server SHALL provide the ITI-102 Token Introspection transaction service.</p>
<h4 id="34113-resource-server">34.1.1.3 Resource Server</h4>
<p>The Resource Server provides services to access protected resources that need authorization. In IUA the Resource Server accepts a HTTP RESTful transaction request with an incorporated access token. It evaluates the access token to verify that the Authorization Server has authorized the transaction. The Resource Server MUST enforce this authorization and MAY perform additional authorization decisions that are specific to the requested service. The Resource Server MAY then allow the transaction to proceed, subject to access control constraints that MAY also be in place.</p>
<p>Resource Servers declaring the Authorization Server Metadata option SHALL have the means to be configured by interacting with an Authorization Server metadata endpoint. The obtained configuration information includes endpoint locations, token format, and signing key materials. This information simplifies the configuration of a Resource Server by allowing the majority of this information to be requested from an Authorization Server.</p>
<p>The Resource Server declaring the Token Introspection option SHALL have the ability to use the Token Introspection transaction to obtain the details of the token from the Authorization Server. This transaction can be used by the Resource Server when it is uncertain about the format of the token (JWT, SAML, or opaque), or when it wants to re-evaluate the authorization policy. To be able to invoke the introspection endpoint, the Resource Server MUST authenticate itself. It MAY obtain a access token of its own from the Authorization Server for this purpose.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Resource Servers and Authorization Servers MAY be grouped into an integrated product together with user authentication, access control, and other services.</p></li>
<li><p>In general, Resource Servers perform additional access control decisions and MAY restrict responses even for transactions authorized by the Authorization Server.</p></li>
<li><p>When the Incorporate Authorization Token is to be used with a FHIR server, Resource Server SHALL declare support for IUA in the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities">capabilities</a> endpoint using the element <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/capabilitystatement.html"><strong>CapabilityStatement.rest.security.service</strong></a> and the code "IUA" at system canonical URL "<a href="http://profiles.ihe.net/fhir/ihe.securityTypes/CodeSystem/securityTypes">http://profiles.ihe.net/fhir/ihe.securityTypes/CodeSystem/securityTypes</a>".</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="342-iua-actor-options">34.2 IUA Actor Options</h2>
<p>Resource Server and Authorization Server actors SHALL support at least one of the following three options: the JSON Web Token option, the SAML Token option or the Token Introspection Option. The Authorization Client is not and does not need to be aware of the token processing options.</p>
<p>The <strong>Authorization Server Metadata option</strong> enables automated configuration of Resource Servers and Authorization Clients by enabling them to pull configuration metadata directly from the Authorization Server.</p>
<p>The <strong>JWT Token Option</strong> uses JSON Web Token encoding of the Token issued by the Authorization Server. The JSON Web Token constraints are defined in <a href="#371422-json-web-token-option">3.71.4.2.2 JSON Web Token Option</a></p>
<p>The <strong>SAML Token Option</strong> enables integration of environments that use both, XUA compatible SAML access token and the OAuth authorization infrastructure.</p>
<p>The <strong>Token Introspection Option</strong> uses the ITI-102 Token Introspection transaction to validate and obtain the claims associated with an access token. These are the same claims as described in <a href="#371422-json-web-token-option">3.71.4.2.2 JSON Web Token Option</a>. Introspection allows for custom token formats and re-evaluation of tokens after commission (enabling features like token revocation), at the cost of introspection calls to the Authorization Server.</p>

<h2 id="344-iua-overview">34.4 IUA Overview</h2>
<h3 id="3441-concepts">34.4.1 Concepts</h3>
<p>The term "authorization" and "access control" are used colloquially for a variety of related activities. All of the concepts listed below are sometimes called "authorization" or "access control". See the IHE ITI Access Control white paper for a detailed discussion of Access Control concepts. This profile will use more specific terms for each of these activities. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provisioning -- Setting up the initial rules and updating them when the situation changes. The administrator may say "Authorize Dr. X to have access". The steps taken to make this happen are called provisioning.</p></li>
<li><p>Delegation -- Adding, transferring and revoking authorization from one person to another. This is closely related to provisioning. It differs in that it can only transfer authority that has already been provisioned, and it may track changes to provisioned access for the original person.</p></li>
<li><p>Authentication -- Determining that the actual user (at the moment of authentication) is the claimed identity.</p></li>
<li><p>Authorization -- Determining that the authenticated user is authorized to have access to a resource (at the moment of authorization). The profile describes how to convey authorization decisions. It is not defining how the decision is made.</p></li>
<li><p>Access Control -- A system of provisioning, delegation, authentication, and authorization. It is normal to have multiple nested levels of access control. This profile is concerned with whether access is allowed to make the HTTP transaction requests to the specified resources. There are likely also building access controls, Resource Server access controls, and other access controls involved.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="34412-terminology">34.4.1.2 Terminology</h4>
<p>This profile uses the terms "access token", "refresh token", "bearer token", "Authorization Server", "Resource Server", "authorization endpoint", "authorization request", "authorization response", "token endpoint", "grant type", "access token request", and "access token response" as defined by The OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework [OAuth 2.1].</p>
<p>Additionally, this profile uses the terms "token introspection", "introspection endpoint", "introspection request", and "introspection response" as defined by the OAuth2 Token Introspection specification [RFC7662].</p>
<p>The OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework uses the term "resource owner" for the user an authorized client may access data on behalf of. Typically in health related environments a healthcare professional access patients or organization related data (resources) for which the healthcare professional is not the "legal owner" but may access according to the access policies of the environment. To avoid any misunderstandings related to the OAuth term "resource owner" and the term "legal owner", this profile uses the term "user" instead.</p>
<p>In accordance with the definitions in the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework [OAuth 2.1] this profile distinguishes confidential clients, credentialed clients and public clients as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>confidential client</em> - a client which stores the client authentication data (e.g., client_id and client_secret) in a way, that the user has no access to it (e.g., a server hosted web application).</p></li>
<li><p><em>credentialed client</em> - a client which has credentials, but their identity has been not been confirmed by the Authorization Server.</p></li>
<li><p><em>public client</em> - a client where the user (in principle) has access to the client code and client data. Public clients cannot store client authentication data in a confidential way (e.g., single page web applications, native mobile apps on a device, if no additional features are implemented to make the client authentication data unavailable for the user).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> A public client classification does not automatically mean the client is insecure. Public clients typically are under the full control of the user (e.g., a native app on the users device) and secured against malicious attacks. Public clients just cannot hide authentication data from the user, making client authentication useless.</p>
<h3 id="3442-use-cases">34.4.2 Use Cases</h3>
<h4 id="34421-authorization">34.4.2.1 Authorization</h4>
<p>This profile applies to use cases where a user authorizes an client application to access health data on behalf of the user using OAuth. Beyond other, relevant use cases are:</p>
<p>A healthcare professional uses a server hosted web application to access a patient's electronic health record (EHR) using RESTful transactions. The web application has been registered beforehand at the Authorization Server with client identifier and client authentication method (e.g. client secret) by a system administrator. When accessing a view on the EHR, the browser is redirected to the EHR Authorization Server. The Authorization Server authenticates the healthcare professional either by presenting the views to enter the authentication factors (e.g. username, password and 2nd factor) or by redirecting to an Identity Provider (IdP). This step may be omitted, if the browser already has an authenticated session (e.g. session cookie). After user authentication, the Authorization Server performs the necessary steps to authorize the web application access to the EHR data with application specific scope, either by contract or by explicit consent given by the healthcare professional. When authorized, the web application retrieves an access token which authorizes it to request and retrieve the EHR data from the Resource Server(s) with an application specific scope on behalf of the healthcare professional.</p>
<p>A healthcare professional uses a single page web application to access a patients electronic health record (EHR) using RESTful transactions. At initial startup the app registers with the Authorization Server using a dynamic client registration protocol. When accessing a view on the EHR, the steps follow the same steps as in the web application use case above.</p>
<p>A clinical monitor managed by the hospital system administrators access a patients EHR using RESTful transactions in the hospital LAN. At installation time, clinical monitor has been registered at the Authorization Server with client identifier and client authentication method (e.g. client secret) by the system administrator and a contracts (policies) have been deposited at the Authorization Server and Resource Server(s) authorizing access to the EHR with application specific scope. Before accessing patient EHR data, the clinical monitor requests an access token from the Authorization Server (e.g. using the client credential grant type). The clinical monitor incorporates the access token to the RESTful transactions to access EHR data and documents stored in the EHR Resource Server(s) with an application specific scope.</p>
<p>A patient uses a native app on her mobile device to access data from her electronic health record (EHR) using RESTful transactions via the Internet. At first startup the app registers with the Authorization Server using a dynamic client registration protocol. When accessing a view on the EHR, the native app is redirected to the EHR Authorization Server, which authenticates the patient either by presenting the views to enter the authentication factors (e.g. username, password and 2nd factor) or by delegating to an Identity Provider (IdP). After user authentication, the Authorization Server performs the necessary steps to authorize the native app to access to the EHR data with application specific scope by explicit user consent. When authorized, the native app retrieves an access token which authorizes the app to request and retrieve the EHR data from the Resource Server(s) with an application specific scope on behalf of the patient.</p>
<p>The limitation of the scope is common to all use cases and on of the key concepts of OAuth to ensure data privacy protection by user consent. While the need for restricting the scope might be less obvious for primary system applications, it is apparently for mobile or web applications which provide specific services for patients or healthcare professionals, e.g., for medication or vaccinations or other specific use cases. An Authorization Server therefore in general will present a form to the user to consent to an application specific and limited scope, e.g., to specific transactions, document types or classes or subject specific data the application is authorized to access.</p>
<h4 id="34422-delegation">34.4.2.2 Delegation</h4>
<p>There are multiple reasons to perform delegations. These cases primarily involve patient delegation choices. Providers rarely have the authority to delegate. IT staff may use delegation as part of the support for autonomous devices.</p>
<p>Users may delegate authority to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Advocates and proxies who are authorized by the patient to make decisions for the patient.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizations that are acting for the patient, such as a visiting nurse organization that is providing support to the patient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Revocation of delegation needs to be clearly specified by policy. Revocation may be removal of rights because of swapping devices. Expiration, re-authorization, etc. also need to be covered. Revocation is not just a response to breaches and failures. Revocation is a normal response to changes in people, equipment, and relationships.</p>
<h2 id="345-iua-security-considerations">34.5 IUA Security Considerations</h2>
<p>IUA uses OAuth 2.1 which contains references to security analyses. There are also a variety of analyses available in the public literature. This profile does not introduce new considerations to those analyses. We have not identified any new healthcare related issues.</p>
<p>For confidential clients this profiles requires client authentication using client_id and client_secret, if no other reliable client authentication method is used, and the client registration with a fixed redirect_uri.</p>
<p>IUA does not address issues around issuing and revoking client_ids. OAuth 2.1 relies upon the client_id for client identification and authorization. OAuth 2.1 does not further define how client_ids are managed.</p>
<p>Usually Authorization Server publish web forms where system administrators and users can apply for a client_id. OAuth 2.1 defines a mechanism for dynamically registering clients with Authorization Servers, by defining a set of desired client metadata values to be made available to the Authorization Servers [OAuth 2.1, Section 2].</p>
<p>The Authorization Server will have an administratively managed list of approved client_ids for accepted clients. This list will be updated as new clients are approved or existing clients are removed. An access token will not be issued for unapproved clients. This assumes that the client_id management will deal with these security considerations in a manner similar to the certificate management assumptions made for secure communication transactions.</p>
<p>The Authorization Server will typically have an administratively managed list of approved Resource Servers. The list of Resource Servers is used in access control decisions to determine if a client has access to a Resource Server. These access control decisions take place when an access token is created, are associated with the access token, and may be re-evaluated when an access token is introspected. Introspection is initiated by a Resource Server just prior to servicing a client request. Introspection can therefore can be used to signal token revocation, or provide Resource Server specific authorization results (such as a limited view on the authorized scopes).</p>
<h2 id="346-iua-cross-profile-considerations">34.6 IUA Cross Profile Considerations</h2>
<p>The XUA profile provides equivalent functionality for SOAP based transactions. Both profiles, XUA and IUA define a transaction to incorporate a token into transactions accessing protected data. Both profiles have much in common, but also some remarkable differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The XUA profile names a transaction to retrieve an SAML 2 assertion for authorization (Get X-User Assertion), but does not specify it in detail, leaving the details to national extensions and project specific implementations. In contrast the IUA profiles specifies the analog Get Authorization Token [ITI-71] for OAuth 2.1 compliant access token.</p></li>
<li><p>While the XUA profile relies on ATNA Node Authentication to authenticate the client (or client network node), IUA uses the mechanism defined in the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework to authenticate client applications.</p></li>
<li><p>While XUA supports SAML 2 Assertions only, the IUA profile supports access token in JWT, SAML 2.0 Assertion or custom formats (in case the Introspect option is implemented).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The SAML token option in IUA enables an Authorization Client to incorporate access token originally retrieved and issued from a XUA X-Assertion Provider and use it in the Incorporate Authorization Token [ITI-72] transaction, when accessing protected data from a Resource Server via RESTful transactions.</p>

<h2 id="371-get-authorization-token">3.71 Get Authorization Token</h2>
<p>This transaction is used by Authorization Clients to obtain an OAuth 2.1 compliant access token for use in a RESTful transaction to access data from a Resource Server.</p>
<p>The OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework [OAuth 2.1, Section 4] defines the following authorization grant types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Authorization Code Grant</em> [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.1]. This grant type is optimized for confidential clients who make use of User Agents (e.g., web browsers).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Client Credentials Grant</em> [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.2]. This grant type is optimized for clients requesting access tokens using only its client credentials and is restricted to confidential clients (e.g., medical devices, back end applications).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework further defines extension points to implement extension grant types [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.3]. Three are mentioned here specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Device Authorization</em> [RFC 8628]: This grant type is optimized for devices that cannot use a browser to perform a user-agent-based authorization or don’t provide interfaces for the user to input text required for authorization and authentication (e.g., medical devices, mobile health sensors).</p></li>
<li><p><em>SAML Client or User Assertions</em> [RFC 7522]: To use a SAML Assertion as a credential for client or user authentication, the Authorization Client SHALL perform the access token request in conformance with the <em>SAML 2.0 Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</em>. This type of grant MAY be used to exchange a XUA Compliant SAML 2.0 assertion to a token format preferred by the Authorization Server.</p></li>
<li><p><em>JSON Web Token (JWT) grants</em> [RFC 7523]: To use a JWT Token as credential for client or user authentication, the Authorization Client SHALL perform the access token request in conformance with the <em>JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants</em>. This type of grant provides better security properties than the client credential flow as it allows for asymmetric keys to be used for client and user authentication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The SAML and JWT grants from RFC7522 and RFC7523 MAY be used in federation scenarios where an Authorization Server will accept tokens from another Authorization Server as credentials for issuing access tokens.</p>
<p>Both the RFC7522 and RFC7523 require the existence of a public key infrastructure. The operational aspects of such infrastructure are beyond the scope of this specification.</p>
<p>This profile is scoped to the <em>Authorization Code</em> and <em>Client Credential</em> grant types. To claim compliance with this profile, the Authorization Server SHALL support the <em>Authorization Code</em> and <em>Client Credential</em> grant type and MAY support the <em>Device Authorization</em>, <em>SAML Client or User Assertions</em>, <em>JSON Web Token (JWT) Grants</em> or other OAuth 2.1 extension grant types.</p>

<p>The Authorization Server SHALL verify that all required parameters of the authorization request are present and valid. If valid, the Authorization Server SHALL authenticate the user and obtain the user consent (by presenting the user a form to authorize specific scopes or by establishing approval via other means). When the user consent is established, the Authorization Server SHALL issue an authorization code to the client redirect URI conveying the authorization code and client state value.</p>

<p>If the access token request is valid and authorized, the Authorization Server responds the access token response message in JSON format with the following attributes [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.2.3]:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>token_type</em> (REQUIRED): The value of the parameter SHALL be <em>Bearer</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>access_token</em> (REQUIRED): A JSON string containing the access token. The format of the access token string depends on the supported JWT Token, SAML Token or Introspect Token options.</p></li>
<li><p><em>scope</em> (REQUIRED): The scope granted by the Authorization Server.</p></li>
<li><p><em>expires_in</em> (OPTIONAL): This parameter MAY be used to inform the Authorization Client how long the access token is valid.</p></li>
<li><p><em>refresh_token</em> (OPTIONAL): A token provided by the Authorization Server which can be used by the Authorization Client to obtain new access tokens using the same authorization grant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The access token response MAY contain other parameter or extensions depending on the implementation details of the Authorization Server [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.2.3].</p>
<p>The Authorization Server SHALL include the HTTP <em>Cache-Control</em> response header field with value <em>no-store</em> and the <em>Pragma</em> response header field value <em>no-cache</em> to the access token response [OAuth 2.1, Section 4.2.3].</p>

<p>Other algorithms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>ES256</em>: ECDSA using P-256 curve and the SHA-256 hash algorithm ("ES256") are RECOMMENDED. Other algorithms MAY be supported except the "NONE" that MUST NOT be used.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> It is RECOMMENDED to use asymmetric (public-key based, e.g., RS256) methods for signing access token. When asymmetric methods are used, Resource Server do not need to store sensitive symmetric keys, making these methods more robust against malicious attacks.</p>
<p>In the JSON Web Token option the access token is defined as JSON object with the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>iss</em> (REQUIRED): A single valued string identifying the instance which issued the access token (e.g.,the Authorization Server) [JWT Access Token, Section 2.2].</p></li>
<li><p><em>sub</em> (REQUIRED): If known, unique identifier of the user; the <em>client_id</em> otherwise [JWT Access Token, Section 2.2].</p></li>
<li><p><em>client_id</em> (REQUIRED): identifier of the client for which the token is issued. [JWT Access Token, Section 2.2]</p></li>
<li><p><em>aud</em> (REQUIRED): An array of identifier strings for the Resource Server endpoints to be accessed [JWT Access Token, Section 2.2]. In the special case when the JWT has one audience, the "aud" value MAY be a single case-sensitive string.</p></li>
<li><p><em>jti</em> (REQUIRED): A unique identifier for the JWT access token [JWT Access Token, Section 2.2].</p></li>
<li><p><em>exp</em> (REQUIRED): Expiration time of the token in Numeric Date format [JWT Access Token, Section 2.2].</p></li>
<li><p><em>scope</em> (REQUIRED): The scope granted by the Authorization Server [JWT Access Token, Section 2.2.3].</p></li>

<p>The Resource Server SHALL be able to determine the token format (JWT, SAML or other) through evaluating the "access_token_format" value in the Authorization Server Metadata document (see ITI-103), inspection of the access token value, or otherwise. When the Resource Server is not able to process the token format (through local verification or introspection) it MUST respond with HTTP 401 (Unauthorized).</p>
<p>The Resource Server SHALL validate or introspect the access token and ensure that it has not expired.</p>
<p>If the token includes a scope claim, the Resource Server SHALL verify, that the scope covers the transaction to the requested resource [OAuth 2.1, Section 7].</p>
<p>If the token includes an audience claim, the Resource Server SHALL verify, that the audience includes the Resource Server itself [OAuth 2.1, Section 7].</p>
<p>The Resource Server SHALL verify, that the claims conveyed in the access token match the transaction type and data (E.g., verify that the patient_id attribute of the access token corresponds to the patient_id of the resource request).</p>
<p>In addition, the Resource Server SHALL enforce the access policies set in the specific environment by matching the information from the access token and the transaction data to the access policies.</p>
<p>If the token verification, scope matching or the access policy enforcement fails, the Resource Server SHALL respond a HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) error.</p>
<p>Authorization Clients receiving a HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) error SHOULD NOT retry the request with the same token. An Authorization Client SHOULD reformulate the request or obtain a new token from the Authorization Server before retrying.</p>

<h2 id="3102-introspect-token">3.102 Introspect Token</h2>
<p>Token introspection defines a protocol that allows Resource Servers to query the Authorization Server to determine the set of claims for a given token that was presented to them by an Authorization Client. These claims include whether or not the token is currently active and the authorization context in which the token was granted.</p>
<p>Token introspection allows a Resource Server to query this information regardless of whether or not it is carried in the token itself (e.g. as encoded in a JWT token), allowing this method to be used along with or independently of structured token values.</p>
<p>The Authorization Server MAY decide to mark an token as active or inactive based on internal policies executed during introspection. For example, a token MAY be marked inactive if it has expired, been revoked, or if the introspection requesting Resource Server is not part of the intended audience of the token. Note that the introspection response for inactive tokens do not contain other (privacy/security sensitive) claims, nor do they mention the reason why the token is marked inactive.</p>
<p>Additionally, token introspection is carried out in the context of a particular Resource Server, allowing the returned authorization claims to be tuned to that authorization context. For example, the Authorization Server MAY limit the list of scopes to those that are deemed relevant for the particular Resource Server.</p>

<li>[02-05] The Authorization Client as well as the Resource Server independently obtain their access tokens from the Authorization Server. The Resource Server requires this token to invoke the introspection endpoint.</li>
<li>[06] The Authorization Client will invoke a Resource Server endpoint embedding the access token in the request.</li>
<li>[07-08] The Resource Server obtains the authorization claims associated with the token from the Authorization Server by invoking the introspect endpoint. This step MAY be omitted if the Resource Server has a cached introspect response value for the access token (including responses where the <em>active</em> field was set to false).</li>
<li>[09] The Resource Server will evaluate the token claims, enforce any access control policies and return the requested resources to the Authorization Client.</li>

<p>The Resource Server Actor SHALL perform a HTTP POST request to the introspect endpoint with the following parameters using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format [RFC7662]:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>token (REQUIRED)</em> : The string value of the token. This is the Authorization Client's access_token as received in the Authorization header in the request towards the Resource Server as defined in transaction ITI-72.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Resource Server stating conformance to the Authorization Server Metadata Option SHALL use the introspect endpoint as contained in the Authorization Server's metadata document.</p>
<p>The Token Introspection Request MUST be protected through TLS.</p>
<p>The Resource Server MUST securely identify himself towards the Authorization Server by using credentials agreed between the Authorization Server and Resource Server. To this end, the introspect request is modelled as specialization of the ITI-72 transaction. This implies that the Resource Server MUST authenticate itself using a Bearer access token towards the Authorization Server. The Resource Server MAY obtain an access token from the Authorization Server using transaction ITI-71.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The use of bearer tokens to authorize the introspect request will not lead to circular references to introspect. The Authorization Server is expected to natively understand the bearer tokens it created and therefore does not need to call introspect on itself.</p>

<h5 id="3102413-expected-actions">3.102.4.1.3 Expected Actions</h5>
<p>Upon receiving the introspect request, the Authorization Server MUST evaluate the Resource Server access to the introspect endpoint. In accordance to ITI-72, when access to the introspect endpoint is not allowed, the Authorization Server MUST return HTTP 401 (Not Authorized).</p>
<p>The Authorization Server SHALL:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validate the structure and authenticity of the token to be introspected</li>
<li>Validate the active state of the token (e.g. check expiry or revocation)</li>
<li>Evaluate configured access policies taking into account the authorization claims related to the token and the Resource Server identity</li>
<li>formulate and return a introspect response</li>

<p>The manner in which the Authorization Clients or Resource Server are configured with the Authorization Server metadata endpoint locations is beyond the scope of this transaction.</p>
<h5 id="3103413-expected-actions">3.103.4.1.3 Expected Actions</h5>
<p>Upon receiving a metadata request, the Authorization Server SHOULD respond with the metadata document as described in section <a href="#310342-authorization-server-metadata-response">3.103.4.2</a>.</p>
<p>Implementations supporting multi-tenancy MUST respond with different metadata documents for different tenants, providing at least a different issuer value.</p>
<p>Requests for metadata for non-existing tenants MUST result in a HTTP 404 (not found) response.</p>
<h4 id="310342-authorization-server-metadata-response">3.103.4.2 Authorization Server Metadata Response</h4>
<p>The response is a set of claims about the Authorization Server's configuration, including all necessary endpoints and public key information.</p>
<h5 id="3103421-trigger-events">3.103.4.2.1 Trigger Events</h5>
<p>The Authorization Server Metadata Response message is returned as response to a valid Authorization Server Metadata Request.</p>
<h5 id="3103422-message-semantics">3.103.4.2.2 Message Semantics</h5>
<p>The response is a set of claims about the Authorization Server's configuration, including all necessary endpoints and public key location information.</p>
<p>The response MUST be structured as a plain JSON document.</p>
<p>The document MUST be structured according to the rules set forth in [RFC8414, Section 2], with the additional constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>issuer (REQUIRED)</em>: The Authorization Server's issuer identifier, which is a URL that uses the "https" scheme and has no query or fragment components. The URL MUST use the "https" scheme. The URL MUST contain the domain name of the URL at which the metadata document can be retrieved. The URL MUST contain any path elements referring to a tenant. Other path elements, such as those referring to the document location (e.g., ".well-known" or "openid-configuration") SHOULD be omitted. E.g., a valid issuer associated with a metadata document retrievable at <code>https://example.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/tenant1</code> would be <code>https://example.com/tenant1</code>.</li>
<li><em>authorization_endpoint (REQUIRED)</em>: Authorization Server Authorization endpoint as used for the "authorization code" flow.</li>
<li><em>token_endpoint (REQUIRED)</em>: Authorization Server Authorization token endpoint location</li>
<li>jwks_uri (CONDITIONAL). URL of the Authorization Server's JWK Set [RFC7517, Section 5] document. Authorization Server supporting the JWT Token or SAML token options MUST provide this claim to communicate the public keys that can be used to verify JWT token or SAML token signatures.</li>
<li><em>scopes_supported (OPTIONAL)</em>: The list of scopes supported by the Authorization Server. Note that IUA itself does not define the scopes of the transactions. Authorization Servers MAY opt to publish a subset of the scopes usable.</li>
<li><em>response_types_supported (REQUIRED)</em>: As the implicit grant flow is not supported in OAuth2.1, the response types SHOULD NOT include the value "token". Authorization Servers MUST include the response type "code". Authorization Servers supporting [OpenId Connect] or other standards MAY include other token types, such as "id_token".</li>
<li><em>grant_types_supported (REQUIRED)</em>: A JSON array listing the type of grants supported toward the token endpoint. The list MUST include the values "client_credentials", and "authorization_code". Authorization Servers supporting refresh tokens MUST include "refresh-token". Authorization Servers supporting the JWT grant MUST include "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer". Authorization Servers supporting the SAML grant MUST include "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer". Authorization Servers supporting other types of grants SHOULD provide additional values to this list representing those grant types.</li>
<li><em>token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported (OPTIONAL)</em>: JSON array containing a list of client authentication methods supported by this token endpoint. When provided, this list MUST include "client_secret_basic".</li>
<li><em>introspection_endpoint (CONDITIONAL)</em>: URL of the Authorization Server's OAuth 2.0 introspection endpoint. This claim MUST be provided by Authorization Servers supporting the Token Introspection Option.</li>
<li><em>introspection_endpoint_auth_methods_supported (CONDITIONAL)</em>: JSON array containing a list of client authentication methods supported by the introspection endpoint. This claim MUST be provided by Authorization Servers supporting the Token Introspection Option. As the introspect option mandates support for Resource Server bearer access tokens, this claim MUST include the "Bearer" value. Other authentication methods (e.g., "client_secret_basic") are allowed when supported by the Authorization Server.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the claims provided in [RFC8414] Authorization Servers SHOULD provide the following claim:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>access_token_format (OPTIONAL)</em>: JSON string defining the format of the access token as provided by the Authorization Server. This allows Resource Servers to learn about methods of verification. Authorization Server actors supporting the JWT Token option MUST set this claim value to "ihe-jwt". Authorization Server actors supporting the SAML Token Option MUST set this claim value to "ihe-saml". Authorization Servers providing tokens that are non-parsable MUST set this value to "opaque". Authorization Servers supporting access tokens in other structured formats MAY use alternative format identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="3103423-expected-actions">3.103.4.2.3 Expected Actions</h5>
<p>The Authorization Client or Resource Servers requesting the metadata document SHALL use the endpoint locations from the metadata document in their interactions with the Authorization Server.</p>
<p>The Authorization Client or Resource Servers requesting the metadata document SHOULD use the JWK values retrieved from the jwks_uri endpoint published in the metadata document for validating JWT and/or SAML tokens.</p>
<p>Resource Servers requesting the metadata document SHOULD use the "access_token_format" claim to determine the method of token validation and usage (e.g. interpret and validate access token as JWT structure).</p>
<h3 id="31035-security-considerations">3.103.5 Security Considerations</h3>
<p>All security considerations as described in [RFC8414, Section 6.2] MUST be implemented.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The issuer claim value of the metadata document is not-necessarily the same as the issuer claim value associated with access-tokens. The issuer value in the metadata document refers to the source of the metadata document itself. This document MAY point to an token endpoint at a server other than the metadata document server. The issuer claim associated with the access token SHOULD refer to the server that implements the token endpoint.</p>
<p>As the metadata document is intended to support the authorization processes, there is no need to provide client credentials towards the metadata endpoint. To prevent unnecessary disclosure of credentials, the Authorization Server Metadata Request MUST NOT include and credentials from the Authorization Client or Resource Server.</p>
