            <h1 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h1>
            <p>As civilization becomes increasingly connected, it is
            becoming increasingly important and expected that all
            stakeholders in a health information ecosystem can access
            the information they need quickly, seamlessly, and without
            concern for jurisdictional, geographic, or organizational
            boundaries. To do so requires vast information exchange
            networks that span entire countries, or ideally, the
            world.</p>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.ihe.net">Integrating the
            Healthcare Enterprise (IHE)</a> standards profiling
            organization has previously published a <a
            href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/HIE-Whitepaper/index.html">Health
            Information Exchange (HIE) White Paper</a> that gives an
            overview of the IHE integration profiles and policy
            decisions that should be considered when planning the
            architecture of a document sharing community. This white
            paper expands on the HIE White Paper by exploring strategies
            for integrating multiple document sharing communities into
            one federated exchange ecosystem with wide and comprehensive
            reach at the national or global level. Readers are expected
            to be familiar with the concepts and ideas presented in the
            HIE White Paper, as those concepts will be used and expanded
            upon here.</p>
            <h2 id="11-scope">1.1 Scope</h2>
            <p>The scope of this white paper is to expand upon the ITI
            HIE White Paper by providing additional guidance on how
            existing document sharing communities can be interconnected
            to form a unified federated exchange ecosystem with wide and
            comprehensive reach. This white paper will assume that since
            existing networks are being connected, document sharing must
            be federated across the networks, but each network might use
            either a federated or centralized architecture internally.
            This white paper will not address any topics regarding the
            creation of a document sharing community or affinity domain.
            Readers interested in those topics are advised to look to
            the following existing IHE resources:</p>

            Handbook</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that this white paper is primarily intended for
            those wishing to combine existing document sharing networks
            or Health Information Exchanges. Readers interested in
            constructing a new standalone Health Information Exchange
            are advised to refer to the <a
            href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/HIE-Whitepaper/index.html">HIE
            White Paper</a>.</p>
            <p>When document sharing will be federated across networks,
            this white paper recommends the use of a centralized
            directory, likely operated by an entity not part of any of
            the networks, that collects and organizes the organizational
            and business information about all entities in all networks
            in the directory as well as the technical details needed to
            facilitate document sharing among them all. Examples will be
            based on the <a
            href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/mCSD/index.html">mCSD</a>
            Profile, which offers the functionality needed by such a
            directory, and also offers a transaction that can be used to
            synchronize the central directory with directories operated
            by each network.</p>
            <p>Networks should expose to each other standard interfaces
            that abstract away their underlying topologies to the
            greatest extent possible. Ideally, these would be the same
            standards based interfaces used to communicate between
            communities within networks, and this can be accomplished
            with thoughtful and consistent use of IHE's integration
            profiles. If this is done well, then understanding the
            design of the other network would not be necessary to
            facilitate communication.</p>
            <p>That said, there are a few instances where members of one
            network might need to understand another network's layout in
            order to interpret the information they are receiving. The
            two cases this white paper will address are:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Situations where information received from another
            network needs to be attributed to a particular organization
            that resides within that other network</li>
            <li>Situations where a message needs to be delivered to a
            particular recipient within another network</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In both of these cases, the centralized directory will be
            used to correlate identifiers in document sharing messages
            with Organization Resources in the directory, such that a
            discrete association can be made programmatically.</p>
            <p>In addressing these use cases, this white paper's scope
            is limited to the exchange of healthcare documents across
            networks. Document exchange provides a good baseline for
            healthcare data interoperability, as it simplifies exchange
            by grouping data into documents. Document sharing allows for
            the exchange of both structured data (for example, CDA or
            FHIR documents) as well as unstructured data (for example,
            scanned documents, PDF files, etc.). This makes document
            exchange a good choice for establishing baseline data
            exchange, whereas other forms of exchange, such as search
            and read of discrete FHIR resources via a RESTful API, are
            more advanced and can be added to an existing exchange
            ecosystem once baseline goals are met. As such, this white
            paper focuses only on document sharing, and does not address
            problems that might arise from other forms of data
            exchange.</p>
            <h2 id="12-intended-audience">1.2 Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>The intended audience of this white paper includes those
            involved in promoting, coordinating, architecting, or
            participating in federated exchange across existing health
            information sharing networks. This white paper covers high
            level data exchange philosophies and architectures, but does
            not cover implementation details. Such details can be found
            in the underlying IHE profiles leveraged here. Furthermore,
            the intended audience is assumed to have a strong
            understanding of document sharing communities and other
            topics covered in the ITI HIE White Paper.</p>
            <p>Some intended audiences include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Those charged with enabling widespread healthcare data
            exchange</li>
            <li>Health Information Exchange Executives and
            Architects</li>
            <li>Health-IT Vendor Architects and Developers</li>
            <li>Standards Development Architects</li>
            <li>Academic Health Data Exchange Stakeholders</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="13-high-level-concepts">1.3 High Level Concepts</h2>
            <p>The following concepts and definitions will be used
            throughout this white paper.</p>
            <h3 id="131-document-sharing-environment">1.3.1 Document
            Sharing Environment</h3>
            <p><strong>Document Sharing Environment</strong> refers to
            any situation where two or more healthcare IT systems are
            exchanging health information in document format. Examples
            of document sharing environments include but are not limited
            to document sharing communities and document sharing
            networks.</p>
            <h3 id="132-document-sharing-community">1.3.2 Document
            Sharing Community</h3>
            <p>A <strong>Document Sharing Community</strong> is a group
            of facilities/enterprises that have agreed to work together
            using a common set of policies for the purpose of sharing
            health information within the community via an established
            mechanism.</p>
            <p>Within each community, there exists a pair of gateways
            that are used to exchange data across community boundaries.
            The Initiating Gateway is used by members within a community
            to send messages to actors outside of the community. The
            Responding Gateway is the access point for actors outside of
            the community to access services within the community. These
            Actors are logically separate, but can be combined into a
            single system at the discretion of the implementer.</p>
            <p>This pattern was established in the <a
            href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-27.html">Cross-Community
            Patient Discovery (XCPD)</a> and <a
            href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-18.html">Cross-Community
            Access (XCA)</a> Profiles, but can be applied to other
            environments as well.</p>
            <h3 id="133-home-community-id">1.3.3 Home Community ID</h3>
            <p>A <strong>Home Community ID</strong> (HCID) is defined by
            <a
            href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume2/ITI-18.html#3.18.4.1.2.3.8">ITI
            TF-2 3.18.4.1.2.3.8</a> as a globally unique identifier for
            a community. Note that in the case where a community
            contains a single organization, a home community ID will
            also uniquely identify that organization, but in the general
            case where a community contains several organizations, the
            HCID will be distinctly different from individual
            organization identifiers.</p>
            <h3 id="134-document-sharing-network">1.3.4 Document Sharing
            Network</h3>
            <p>A <strong>Document Sharing Network</strong> is defined as
            a collection of one or more Document Sharing Communities
            and/or Document Sharing Networks that agree to a common,
            higher level governance structure, participate in document
            sharing with one another, and share network central
            resources, such as a central network directory, among one
            another.</p>
            <p>Document Sharing Networks might provide their participant
            communities with a variety of services. The most common are
            centralized directories, certificate authorities, and
            centralized network gateways.</p>
            <h3 id="135-network-gateway">1.3.5 Network Gateway</h3>
            <p>A <strong>Network Gateway</strong> is a system, central
            to a given network, that facilitates data exchange across
            network boundaries. The Initiating Gateway is used by
            participants within a network to send messages to actors
            belonging to other networks. The Responding Gateway is the
            access point for actors belonging to other networks to
            access services within the network.</p>
            <p>Network Gateways expose the same interfaces and are
            interacted with in the same way as community gateways. The
            difference is that a Network Gateway might provide access to
            several communities. Therefore, where network gateways are
            used, participants can interact with the network gateway in
            the same way as a community gateway, with the caveat that
            the network gateway might process information for several
            Home Community IDs.</p>
            <p>The Initiating and Responding Gateway Actors are used by
            IHE in a variety of cross community integration profiles,
            including XCPD, XCA, and XCDR.</p>
            <p>These concepts are explained further in <a
            href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/HIE-Whitepaper/index.html#33-federated-discovery-and-retrieve">Section
            3.3 of the HIE White Paper</a>.</p>
            <h3 id="136-proxy">1.3.6 Proxy</h3>
            <p>A <strong>Proxy</strong> in the context of document
            sharing is similar to a network gateway in that it brokers
            access across network boundaries. However, it is different
            in that a Proxy has no internal business logic - it exists
            solely to broker trust across the network boundary, and
            possibly provide translation services.</p>
            <p>For example, suppose network 1 exists and is running
            smoothly, with trust between nodes being managed by a
            Certificate Authority internal to the network. However, that
            network then wants to join a higher level network, network
            2, so its participants get access to the participants of the
            higher level, and vice versa. In order to ease the burden of
            federating trust across the multiple networks, network 1
            might introduce a proxy into its infrastructure. That proxy
            would trust, and be trusted by, the members of network 1,
            and also the other members of the higher level network 2.
            The proxy would simply forward requests and responses in
            both directions across the network boundary, accessing
            network 1 on behalf of network 2, and network 2 on behalf of
            network 1.</p>
            <p>A proxy need not be represented in a directory, because
            systems on the network will not necessarily be aware of its
            existence. From their perspective, they are talking directly
            to the system behind the proxy.</p>
            <h3 id="137-central-network-directory">1.3.7 Central Network
            Directory</h3>
            <p>Systems in a network require a method for discovering one
            another. For large networks, manual configuration is not
            feasible, so discovery needs to be automated. Discovery can
            be facilitated by the addition of a central network
            directory into a network.</p>
            <p>A central network directory is a care services directory
            that is central to the network and thus does not have bias
            toward one segment of the network or another. Note that for
            the purpose of this white paper, it matters only that there
            is a logical central network directory. That is to say,
            there might be a number of systems responsible for
            organizing, maintaining, and distributing the directory, but
            it can be thought of as logically a single cohesive
            whole.</p>
            <p>In a multi-layered document sharing network, central
            directories for different layers of the network are likely
            to synchronize partially or entirely with one another in
            order to provide other layers of the network visibility into
            the Organizations present outside of their immediate
            network.</p>

            <p>A <strong>Multi-Layered Document Sharing Network</strong>
            is a document sharing network that contains other document
            sharing networks as members. That is to say, such a network
            is a "network of networks".</p>
            <p>For the sake of clarity, this white paper will refer to
            the most atomic actors in a multi-layered network as the

            Sharing Federation</h3>
            <p><strong>Document Sharing Federation</strong> refers to
            the act of architecting a document sharing network such that
            members within the network exchange healthcare documents
            directly with each other rather than through a central
            actor. Since there is no central actor that drives exchange,
            the network members are forming a federation with one
            another, resulting in the emergence of the document sharing
            network.</p>
            <p>In contrast, a centralized network has one or more
            central actors that act as an information repository, and
            other members communicate directly only with the central
            actors.</p>
            <p>Federation can occur at any layer of a multi-layered
            document sharing network, though it becomes more likely as
            higher and higher layers are added, because centralization
            becomes cumbersome as the network depth increases.</p>

            <p>A <strong>Care Services Directory</strong> is a common,
            authoritative registry of the healthcare organizations,
            locations, practitioners, etc. and their contact information
            (both electronic and otherwise). A document sharing network,
            at minimum, needs a directory that contains the set of
            organizations that are members of the network and the
            communication endpoints for document sharing. More advanced
            networks will also want to have information about the
            network topology in the directory, as well as information
            about the healthcare locations, practitioners,
            jurisdictions, services, and organizational business
            relationships. Such a directory is likely to serve as a
            central network directory for a network.</p>

            <p>In order to successfully and safely exchange patient
            health information within and across document sharing
            communities and networks, it is imperative that the parties
            doing the exchange are able to establish agreement about the
            patient that is the subject of their communication.</p>
            <p>The concepts and profiles discussed in Section 5 of the

            White Paper</a> can be successfully applied across
            communities and networks. An important note is that in cases
            where interaction with network gateways that represent
            multiple communities is needed, only the XCPD Profile
            currently offers the functionality needed to give systems
            outside of the network access to patient identities for each
            community within the network. Other IHE profiles, such as
            the PDQ family of profiles, do not allow distinguishing
            between different identities across different communities,
            and so would only be sufficient when interacting with
            gateways that represent a single community or offer the
            facade of a single community.</p>
            <h3 id="1312-query-and-retrieve">1.3.12 Query and
            Retrieve</h3>
            <p><strong>Document Query and Retrieve</strong> refers to a
            document sharing model where documents are exchanged in a
            two step process. In the first step, the document consumer
            actor sends a request for a list of available documents. In
            the second step, the document consumer actor reviews the
            obtained list of documents and retrieves certain documents
            from the list.</p>
            <p>This model is often referred to as the "pull" model. It
            is generally used in situations where the actors consuming
            the document need to be able to search and retrieve
            information about a patient. This is most often the case for
            end user stories that involve reviewing the medical history,
            or current medical chart, for the patient.</p>

            document sharing model where an information source wants to
            communicate healthcare information to a particular intended
            recipient. In this model, documents are prepared by the

            <h3 id="1314-facade-community">1.3.14 Facade Community</h3>
            <p>Rather than expose internal networks and communities
            directly, a network could be designed to expose a single
            facade community to other networks with which it is
            interconnected. Such a community would have a single Home
            Community ID, different from those of the internal
            communities. The network gateways would therefore be
            responsible for combining information from all of the
            systems within, in order to appear as a single cohesive
            community to the outside.</p>
            <p>A network offering a facade community must be able to act
            as a single community for all interactions. It must maintain
            a patient identity cross reference manager, so that patient
            identities across the internal communities can be combined
            into a single patient identity in the facade community. When
            it receives a document list query, it must be able to
            forward that query to all communities that are part of the
            facade, and combine the responses into a single unified
            response. When it receives a message for delivery, it must
            be able to route the message to the appropriate community
            without using a home community id.</p>
            <p>The advantages of such an architecture is that it offers
            a simplified mechanism for interacting with the network for
            systems outside of the network, at the cost of complicating
            the network architecture.</p>

            id="14-community-vs-network-vs-multi-layered-network">1.4
            Community vs Network vs Multi-Layered Network</h2>
            <p>The concepts of Community, Network, and Multi-Layered
            Network are very similar in concept, so it is important to
            distinguish how those terms are used here.</p>
            <p>A <strong>community</strong> is distinguished as an
            entity that provides infrastructure to allow access to
            healthcare data internally, and provide internal systems
            access to external communities. A community is always
            assigned a Home Community ID that can be used to address the
            community in document sharing.</p>
            <p>A document sharing <strong>network</strong> is
            distinguished as a group of entities with shared governance
            that agree on data sharing policies and technologies. A
            network will typically have some amount of central
            infrastructure. Common central components might include a
            Certificate Authority for facilitating authentication
            between network members, a central directory for
            facilitating network membership discovery, and initiating
            and responding gateways for federating exchange inside and
            outside of the network. A community inherently meets this
            definition, so all communities are networks, but not all
            networks are communities. A network might not be assigned
            its own Home Community ID in the case where it does not
            provide any services that require addressing the network as
            a whole.</p>
            <p>Consider a network that consists of two separate
            communities. The network might contain initiating and
            responding gateways, but if the network delegates patient
            matching to both communities, and forces other requests to
            address a single one of the communities, it would not
            typically be seen as its own community.</p>
            <p>A <strong>multi-layered-network</strong> is simply a
            network that contains other networks within. A multi-layered
            network is itself a general network, but is distinguished by
            the fact that it consists of policy agreements and
            communication infrastructure to facilitate communication
            across different entities that themselves can operate
            independently as networks.</p>

            <h2 id="15-a-note-on-hierarchical-representation">1.5 A Note
            On Hierarchical Representation</h2>
            <p>This white paper considers only networks that have a
            hierarchical based layout. Each Organization connects "up"
            to Organizations that exist at a "higher" level in the
            network, meaning they serve a wider network scope, and
            "down" to Organizations that exist at a "lower" level in the
            network, meaning they server a more narrow scope. This is
            the architecture seen most commonly in exchange communities
            today, and is the natural result of connecting existing
            networks together into a multi-layered network.</p>
            <p>This does not mean that there is a strict hierarchy.
            Single Organizations or Networks might choose to become
            members of multiple higher networks, resulting in the
            potential for multiple paths to a given organization.
            However, the design is still "hierarchical" in that each of
            the higher Organizations is seen as providing resources for
            the single member Organization.</p>
            <p>With that having been said, the purpose of this white
            paper is to demonstrate how such a multi-layered network
            would be represented in a directory, and so it takes the
            perspective of a system examining the directory to locate a
            route. Nothing precludes a network from internally being
            architected using any architecture, be it star, mesh, ring,
            etc. Such a network would still present an interface to the
            outside world, and thus the Organizations within that
            network can be seen as children of the network.</p>

            <p>In the Document Access use case, a user with a legitimate
            need to access healthcare information, such as a member of a
            patient's treatment team, wants to discover all available
            healthcare information for a patient and review information
            that they find most pertinent. Consider the following
            scenario:</p>
            <p>Dr. Suwati is a primary care physician that works for New
            Hope Medical Partners. Her new patient, Vanna Patterson,
            recently moved to the area from across the country. Before
            moving, Vanna had been undergoing cancer treatment for about
            9 months at several healthcare organizations. Since she
            lived in a rural town, her old primary care physician worked
            for a small community health center - Valley Access
            Healthcare. Meanwhile, she received her specialty oncology
            care from a larger, academic health system - University
            Health. To complicate matters, University Health had
            completed a re-branding 4 month's prior, right in the middle
            of Vanna's treatment, which means any healthcare summary
            documents generated prior will have the organization's old
            name. While they are different healthcare organizations,
            Valley Access Healthcare and University Health do belong to
            the same regional HIE.</p>
            <p>Dr. Suwati will be taking over as Vanna's new primary
            care physician, and wants to understand the history and
            progression of Vanna's disease and the treatment she has
            undergone thus far. Dr. Suwati has listened to Vanna recount
            the care she has received, and now Dr. Suwati would like to
            review her medical records to gain clarity from the
            physician point of view. While recounting her medical
            journey, Vanna described most of the care she received in
            the context of the organization where she received it, and
            Dr. Suwati would like to be able to correlate Vanna's story
            with her medical record.</p>
            <p>Dr. Suwati requests her EHR to find all available medical
            records for Vanna using Vanna's patient demographics. The
            EHR searches other communities for patients with Vanna's
            demographics and, once matching patients are found, queries
            for the documents that make up Vanna's chart. Fortunately,
            Dr. Suwati was able to find Vanna's medical records at
            Valley Access Healthcare and University Health. However, she
            also finds that additional records were found at Urgent
            Health. Those documents mentioned that Vanna had had a
            severe reaction to some medication she had been prescribed,
            such that Vanna should not be prescribed that medication
            again. Vanna hadn't mentioned that she was seen at Urgent
            Health, so Dr. Suwati is grateful that the records were
            located automatically. In order to help organize the
            documents, Dr. Suwati requests her EHR to sort the documents
            by date and group by source healthcare organization. Dr.
            Suwati is not concerned with University Health's recent
            rebranding, she wants to see all of the documents available
            from that organization throughout history to gain an
            overview of Vanna's specialty care.</p>
            <p>To meet Dr. Suwati's needs, the EHR needs to be able to
            programmatically broadcast a set of patient discovery
            requests to other communities, evaluate the responses and
            follow-up with queries for medical documents, and then
            correlate the medical documents by discrete Organization. In
            order to respond quickly enough for Dr. Suwati's busy
            schedule, all of this needs to happen efficiently, and
            without actually retrieving or parsing the contents of all
            of the documents that were found.</p>

            Interoperability Challenge</h3>
            <p>For the purpose of this illustration, let's assume that
            the following infrastructure in place:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>New Hope Medical Partners is a participant of a network
            called "Big Health Exchange"</li>
            <li>Valley Access Healthcare, University Health, and Urgent
            Health are participants in a network called "Valley Region
            HIE"</li>
            <li>Both Big Health Exchange and Valley Region HIE are
            further members of a nationwide document sharing network to
            facilitate document sharing between members of both
            exchanges.</li>
            <li>All three networks are built using IHE document sharing
            integration profiles, particularly XCPD and XCA.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Dr. Suwati's goal is to request records from Valley
            Access Healthcare and University health. In order for her to
            instruct her EMR to request records for those organizations,
            the EMR needs to know not only that they exist, but how to
            communicate with them.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <h4 id="problem-1">Problem 1</h4>
            <p>How can an EMR discover the existence of outside
            organizations it does not have a direct trust relationship
            with? How can a route to request information from that
            organization be discovered?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Assuming a solution to Problem 1 is available, then the
            EMR will have identified a community from which the
            patient's record can be requested, and a set of
            communication endpoints that can be used to reach that
            community. In order to communicate the patient for which
            records are requested, the patient's identity within that
            community must first be determined. The XCPD integration
            profile is used to accomplish that goal.</p>
            <p>For the purpose of this illustration, assume that Valley
            Region HIE is structured as a single community with a single
            patient identifier domain, and Valley Region HIE's XCPD
            Initiating Gateway is reachable via Big Health Exchange's
            Responding Gateway, which will broadcast patient discovery
            requests to all communities it can reach. So, Dr. Suwati can
            determine Vanna's identity in Valley Region HIE by simply
            sending an XCPD request to Big Health Exchange's Responding
            Gateway.</p>
            <p>Once the appropriate responding community and patient
            identifier for that community is determined, healthcare
            documents can be requested via the XCA integration profile.
            The XCPD response will have included a patient identity and
            Home Community ID pair for Vanna's Valley Region HIE record.
            So, the XCA integration profile can be used to request the
            healthcare documents available for Vanna from Valley Region
            HIE.</p>
            <p>Once the data is retrieved, one problem remains, though -
            in order to enable filtering and sorting functionality to
            improve Dr. Suwati's efficiency, the EMR should be able to
            discretely associate each available document with the
            healthcare provider organization that authored it.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <h4 id="problem-2">Problem 2</h4>
            <p>How can Dr. Suwati's EMR discretely correlate the
            received documents by authoring organization? How can they
            be associated with the list of organizations in the
            organization directory that Dr. Suwati has access to?</p>

            <h2 id="22-push">2.2 Push</h2>
            <h3 id="221-user-story">2.2.1 User Story</h3>
            <p>In the Push use case, a user has a message that they want
            to convey to a particular recipient in another, potentially
            far away, community. The destination recipient might be an
            individual, a department at a healthcare organization, or
            other such addressable entity. The user might have a
            particular recipient in mind for which they need to discover
            connectivity, or they might need to be able to discover
            available recipients. Consider the following scenario:</p>
            <p>Dr. Suwati has a patient, Leon Sanford, that has a rare
            neurological disorder that Dr. Suwati is unfamiliar with.
            However, Dr. Suwati knows that University Health, on the
            other side of the country, has a strong reputation for
            treating patients with this disorder. Dr. Suwati wants to
            refer Leon to a neurologist at University Health for
            evaluation. She needs to use her EHR to search the central
            network directory for a list of providers that offer
            neurological services at University Health, and are
            currently accepting new patients. She reviews the list of
            providers with Leon and together they determine that Dr.
            Santos is the best fit for Leon.</p>
            <p>Dr. Suwati prepares a referral order and a letter in
            which she details her treatment of Leon thus far and the
            concerns she has for Dr. Santos to review. Dr. Suwati
            requests her EHR to send the referral, the letter, and a
            summary of care document to Dr. Santos at University
            Health.</p>
            <p>University health is located in another document sharing
            community, but there is a communication path between New
            Hope Medical Partners and University Health. The EHR needs
            to be able to send a message that will be received by the
            community to which University Health is a member and confirm
            that the message was delivered to Dr. Santos at University
            Health.</p>
            <h3 id="222-interoperability-challenge">2.2.2
            Interoperability Challenge</h3>
            <p>The IHE XDR integration profile enables the sending of an
            unsolicited message from a source to a destination, and the
            IHE XCDR integration profile supplement allows for routing
            via Home Community ID. So, if Dr. Suwati's EMR can construct
            a message and send it to an XCDR initiating gateway that has
            access to University Health, then the XCDR initiating
            gateway can route the message to that organization. However,
            before that can happen, the EMR must be able to determine
            that Dr. Santos is a physician that cares for patients at
            University Health, and that University Health is reachable
            via the network. This problem is very similar to Problem 1
            above.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <h4 id="problem-3">Problem 3</h4>
            <p>How can an EMR discover the message transmission route to
            send a message to a recipient at an outside organization
            which which it does not have a direct trust
            relationship?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If Problem 3 were to be solved, then the EMR would know
            that by sending an XDR message with the Transmits Home
            Community ID option to the Big Health Exchange initiating
            gateway, it can ensure that the message is routed to the
            Valley Region HIE. But that is not sufficient for Dr. Santos
            to receive it, the message needs to be further routed to his
            incoming mail box at University Health. This is the final
            problem this white paper seeks to address:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <h4 id="problem-4">Problem 4</h4>
            <p>How can a pushed message be addressed to an individual or
            organization within a community?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>As will be illustrated below, the use of a centralized
            directory to represent the network topology is one solution
            to greatly facilitate the solution to these problems.</p>
            <h1 id="3-example-network-topologies">3 Example Network
            Topologies</h1>
            <p>This white paper does not specify or endorse any
            particular network topology. Instead, it recommends the use
            of standard exchange interfaces at the network gateway
            level, so that when networks must be interconnected, they
            can be regardless of topology. What follows are possible
            example network topologies:</p>
            <h2 id="31-single-organization-community">3.1 Single

            <p>It is possible for a singleton organization to form a
            community by itself, and for that community to interface
            directly with other networks.</p>
            <p>The community might be architected as an XDS Affinity
            Domain or some other architecture. More information is

            <p>Multiple organizations can also join together into a
            community. In this case, querying the community responding
            gateway will return results for data produced by both
            organizations.</p>
            <p>The below example shows one such topology, where two
            organizations have chosen to belong to the same XDS Affinity
            Domain and therefore share the same XDS infrastructure.</p>

            Community</h2>
            <p>A community might have a fairly complex architecture
            internally. It might even be composed of many organizations
            that exchange data using proprietary mechanisms. However, if
            the community exposes gateways that are able to abstract
            away the internal complexities and expose data in the form
            of documents, then it can successfully act as a node in a
            multi-layered document sharing network.</p>
            <p>In this example, a community is made up of three
            organizations that exchange data using proprietary methods.
            The Responding Gateway includes functionality to access this
            data and generates documents on-demand that can be shared
            with others in the network. As such, the interface exposed
            is the same as the single affinity domain case, even though
            the internal architecture is quite different!</p>

            Community Network</h2>
            <p>Multiple communities can be joined together to form a
            network of communities. The network infrastructure can offer
            initiating and responding gateways that make the internals
            of the network accessible to other networks. This would
            allow other networks access to all communities in the
            network, but they would typically need to interact with one
            community at a time.</p>
            <p>The XCPD integration profile provides a mechanism to
            query the network with patient demographics with the result
            being the list of community+patient identifier pairs that
            have data for the patient. Each community can be queried for
            data using the patient ID for that community via the network
            gateway. This is a bit more burdensome on consumers in other
            networks. If it is desired to interact with the network as
            if it were a single community, then architecting a facade
            community might be considered.</p>
            <p>The following diagram shows an example of a
            multi-community network. The network contains three
            communities, the inner details of which are not shown:</p>

            Network</h2>
            <p>Similar to a multi-community network, multiple networks
            can be joined together to form larger, interconnected
            networks. Similar to multi-community networks, actors
            external to a multi-layered network can broadcast a patient
            query into the network and get back a patient identifier for
            each community within. The patient identifiers can then be
            used to query for documents.</p>
            <p>By layering networks in this way, the interconnection of
            different networks can be accomplished in a way that
            provides a consistent interface for actors both within and
            outside of each network.</p>

            topologies might be represented in a central network

            <h2 id="41-purpose-built-vs-comprehensive-directories">4.1
            Purpose-Built vs. Comprehensive Directories</h2>
            <p>Many Endpoint directories that are in production at the
            time of this writing are purpose-built, which is to say they
            only store information about organization, location, and
            endpoint information. The sole use case of these directories
            is endpoint lookup, and for this reason, directories often
            reflect network details directly in the Organization
            resource, such as:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The organization's role in the network, like participant
            or sub-participant, expressed as the type of
            organization</li>
            <li>The organization's relationship to its connectivity
            parent, expressed as the organization hierarchy (i.e.,
            Organization.partOf in FHIR)</li>
            <li>The organization's connectivity state</li>
            <li>Supported communication profiles, purposes of use,
            etc.</li>
            <li>A single type of organizational identifier, most
            commonly used as the Home Community ID for IHE cross
            community integration profiles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The purpose-built nature of these directories makes
            representation of other organizational hierarchies, such as
            business relationships and jurisdictional governance,
            challenging. This is because business, jurisdictional, and
            technical system relationships tend to have organizational
            hierarchies that do not match one another. A directory
            purpose-built for electronic endpoint exchange tends to
            prioritize technical system relationships in hierarchical
            representations, which means that other types of
            hierarchical relationships are not represented properly.
            This is a significant drawback, as electronic communication
            information becomes more useful when paired with information
            that non-technical end users might find relevant.</p>
            <p>For example, suppose a clinician works for a staffing
            organization that contracts out services to several
            healthcare provider organizations, and that clinician has a
            specific electronic delivery address for each healthcare
            provider organization. An individual trying to message that
            clinician about one of their patients would need to
            understand this well enough to choose the correct delivery
            address to send the message to the correct provider
            organization. At the same time, a public health worker might
            want to be able to quickly identify and message all of the
            infection disease experts in their government jurisdiction
            to alert them of a new disease outbreak. As expectations of
            connectedness and automation grow, we predict that it will
            be necessary to have an increasing amount of information
            available in a single, centralized directory. This means
            that it will be necessary to represent multiple disparate
            systemic hierarchies in a single directory.</p>
            <p>The IHE mCSD Integration Profile is well suited to
            address this problem by utilizing the
            OrganizationAffiliation resource to provide for the
            representation of multiple organizational hierarchies, and
            by also considering how the Practitioner and
            PractitionerRole resources can be integrated into such a
            directory. This allows for data about healthcare facilities,
            care services, healthcare workers, and other healthcare
            entities to all exist in a central location along with their
            communication details.</p>
            <h2 id="42-directory-layout-guidance">4.2 Directory Layout
            Guidance</h2>
            <p>In this section, we provide guidance on how to represent
            the example communities introduced in Section 3 in a central
            network directory. This guidance will be focused on a
            central network directory that uses the HL7 FHIR
            Organization, OrganizationAffiliation, Location, and
            Endpoint resources to store directory information. The
            guidance is meant to be compatible with the mCSD Integration
            Profile, so that it can live in a directory that has other
            hierarchical relationships without conflict.</p>
            <h3
            id="421-fhir-resources-used-for-communication-information">4.2.1
            FHIR Resources Used For Communication Information</h3>
            <p>The first question that is asked when document sharing is
            "what are the parties to the exchange?" This question
            implies the use of the Organization Resource to model the
            entities exchanging data. HL7 FHIR defines an Organization
            as a group of people or organizations that form some
            collective of action, such as companies, institutions,
            corporations, departments, community groups, healthcare
            practice groups, healthcare payers, etc. Organizations often
            exist in one or more hierarchies, where those hierarchies
            might represent business entity relationships,
            jurisdictional relationships, IT relationships, etc.
            Organizations have a few key attributes that are relevant
            for Document Sharing:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>A logical Identifier that uniquely identifies the
            Organization as an entity</li>
            <li>The Name by which a human user would know of the
            organization</li>
            <li>Telecommunication identifiers that can be used to reach
            the Organization</li>
            <li>Information about what larger Organization the
            Organization might be part of</li>
            <li>One or more endpoints for electronic communication and
            data exchange</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As stated above, an Organization might belong to a
            variety of hierarchies for different purposes. While the
            Organization Resource can only refer to one parent
            Organization directly, the OrganizationAffiliation Resource
            can be used to establish additional hierarchies. The partOf
            element is typically used to represent business
            relationships (Department X is part of Organization Y which
            is a subsidiary of Organization Z), however, some
            directories might choose to use partOf to also represent
            document sharing access. The OrganizationAffiliation
            Resource establishes a parent-child relationship via its
            organization (parent) and participatingOrganization (child)
            elements. It also has a code element that can be used to
            identify the nature of the relationship between organization
            and participatingOrganization. mCSD defines a code -
            DocShare-federate - to imply that a parent organization
            provides access to documents for its children in a Document
            Sharing Network. Additional codes might be defined by mCSD
            in the future or by directory policy.
            OrganizationAffiliation also has an endpoint element. This
            can be used instead of Organization.Endpoint when it needs
            to be clear that while the Endpoint is child Organization
            specific, it is relevant only in the context of the
            OrganizationAffiliation, rather than in general. This
            understanding is necessary in comprehensive directories
            where access to the endpoint is predicated on having a
            relationship with the parent organization. This is often the
            case for endpoints available on the public internet, since
            document sharing endpoints generally cannot allow access to
            unauthenticated or unauthorized users. In this scenario, the
            OrganizationAffiliation would have .organization pointing to
            an HIE Organization that establishes strong rules for
            governance and provides credentials to each member to access
            the other members' endpoints.</p>
            <p>The third Resource that is critical to establishing
            connectivity is the Endpoint resource. An Organization can
            have one or more Endpoints to represent an access point for
            electronic communication with that Organization. Endpoints
            have a connectionType that define the type of communication
            enabled by that endpoint. For IHE Document Sharing profiles,
            mCSD defines an extension - Endpoint Specific Type - to help
            clarify more information that is needed about the types of
            messages that the Endpoint can process. An Organization is
            likely to point to multiple Endpoint resources - one for
            each connectionType/specific type that the organization is
            able to accommodate. Endpoints have an address that contains
            the technical address to which communication should be
            directed (most often an HTTPS URL). Endpoints are pointed at
            by their respective Organizations, but they also have a
            managingOrganization element that can be used to identify
            the Organization that manages (provides support) for the
            endpoint. While the managingOrganization is often in
            directories and is important for operational support, it
            generally will not be directly used in Document Sharing
            since it does not represent a relationship relevant for data
            access.</p>
            <p>Location Resources describe a physical place where
            services are provided. They are similar to Organization in
            that they have logical identifiers, names, telecom
            information, a hierarchy, and electronic data exchange
            Endpoints. However, since they represent a physical place,
            rather than the actual entity that might provide services or
            maintain IT infrastructure, they are typically not used in
            Document Sharing outside of facilitating discovery of the
            Organization that a user desires to share with.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Practitioner and PractitionerRole Resources
            provide information about individual Practitioners that
            practice at an Organization. They are relevant to
            DocumentSharing in that they will commonly be referenced in
            documents and their metadata, but they are also relevant for
            push use cases in the event a message needs to be delivered
            to an individual.</p>
            <p>Directory policy will dictate the relationships between
            these Resources in the directory. A key decision that needs
            to be made is the primary hierarchy of the directory, i.e.
            what Organization.partOf represents. If the directory is
            comprehensive, it will need to represent multiple
            hierarchies, and so all but one will need to be represented
            using OrganizationAffiliation Resources rather than
            Organization.partOf relationships. The value set of
            OrganizationAffiliation.code will also be critically
            determined by the directory policy, since consumers of the
            directory will need to know how to interpret each hierarchy.
            When deciding how Organization, Endpoint, and
            OrganizationAffiliation Resources should be layed out in the
            directory, the trust policy of the network and the
            perspective of actors in the directory should be considered.
            Nodes in the network will need to be able to determine which
            endpoints are reachable by them from both an IP networking
            and a trust perspective. Careful planning of the directory
            structure can facilitate the programmatic discovery of
            electronically reachable Organizations.</p>
            <h3 id="422-indicating-document-sharing-connectivity">4.2.2
            Indicating Document Sharing Connectivity</h3>
            <p>As stated previously, document sharing relationships
            might be expressed in the directory via Organization.partOf
            or by use of the OrganizationAffiliation Resource.</p>
            <p>Organization.partOf is the simplest way to represent a
            relationship between two Organizations. When child
            organizations have a partOf relationship with a parent,
            there is ambiguity around whether requesting data from, or
            delivering messages to, the parent organization will return
            data from, or route the message to, the child organizations.
            Therefore, this relationship is only feasible in purpose
            built directories where it is obvious what the .partOf
            relationships convey, and the future growth opportunities
            for such a directory are limited. Conversely, a more
            explicit and future proof alternative is to use the
            OrganizationAffiliation resource to convey what document
            sharing access is possible.</p>
            <p>Because the use of partOf is not explicit in whether it
            signifies that a parent Organization provides document
            sharing access to its children, directory policy will need
            to clarify the meaning of partOf with respect to Document
            Sharing. Directory policy that declares organizational
            hierarchy via partOf implies accessibility to child entries,
            meaning:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>For FHIR REST endpoints, the URL is simply the Service
            Base URL as specified in <a
            href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#general">FHIR R4
            3.1.0.1.2</a>. Clients can expect to find resources related
            to Organizations A, B and C.</li>
            <li>For XCA endpoints, a client querying Organization A for
            documents (e.g., using [ITI-38]) may receive documents from
            Organizations A, B and C.</li>
            <li>For XDR endpoints, a client sending a Provide and
            Register Document Set-b ([ITI-41]) request to Organization A
            can optionally specify Organizations B and/or C in
            intendedRecipient.</li>
            <li>For MHD endpoints, a client sending a Provide Document
            Bundle ([ITI-65]) request to Organization A can optionally
            specify Organizations B and/or C in intendedRecipient.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples of this kind of federated structure are shown in
            <a
            href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-E.html#E.9.3">ITI
            TF-1: Appendix E.9</a> for XCA Responding Gateways.</p>
            <p>Possible declarations of partOf relationships could
            include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Declaring that partOf shall be used to signify a
            Document Sharing relationship rather than or in addition to
            business relationships. In this case,
            OrganizationAffiliation might not be used, but this case is
            also the most restrictive and least capable of conveying
            hierarchical nuance.</li>
            <li>Declaring that partOf may indicate that the parent
            provides Document Sharing Access, but only if the child
            Organization in question has no Endpoints of its own and no
            OrganizationAffiliation resources with it as a
            participatingOrganization and a code indicating document
            sharing access.</li>
            <li>Declaring that partOf has no relationship to document
            sharing and any organizations that provide document sharing
            access to children must be linked to the children with an
            OrganizationAffiliation with an appropriate code. This is
            the most explicit policy, but one that might be
            operationally cumbersome to maintain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In all three cases, the Endpoint Discovery Algorithm
            later in this section will identify an endpoint if one
            exists. However, the endpoint discovery algorithm will
            require further configuration to align the notion of a
            "suitable" endpoint with directory policy. For example, if
            the directory policy declares that Organization.partOf shall
            not be used to convey document sharing relationships, then
            the Endpoint Discovery Algorithm should be configured to not
            traverse those relationships.</p>
            <p>In the examples that follow, the OrganizationAffiliation
            Resource is used to convey document sharing connectivity
            information due to its increased versatility. In this white
            paper, the following value set will be used:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>PartnerConnectivity - this code is used to indicate that
            the .participatingOrganization should be able to reach the
            .organization directly via .Endpoint. This code does not
            make any claims about the connectivity available for any
            organizations other than the two directly linked to the
            OrganizationAffiliation Resource. Note that many document
            sharing networks might choose to distribute the information
            needed to establish these connections out of band rather
            than via the directory.</li>
            <li>HIEInitiator - This code is used to indicate that the
            Organization linked in .participatingOrganization is a
            member of the network headed by the Organization in
            .organization, and it has permission and intent to request
            data from other members of the network. In this case,
            OrganizationAffiliation.endpoint represents the endpoint
            used by the .participatingOrganization to make requests of
            the Initiating Gateway under the authority of
            .organization.</li>
            <li>HIEResponder - This code is used to indicate that the
            Organization linked in .participatingOrganization is a
            member of the network headed by the Organization in
            .organization, and it has an Endpoint that accepts requests
            from other members of the network that have an HIEInitiator
            relationship with the network governing Organization. In
            this case, OrganizationAffiliation.endpoint contains
            endpoints used by other network members to send requests to
            .participatingOrganization. This Endpoint may also be used
            by Initiating and Responding gateways operated by the
            .organization.</li>
            <li>DocShare-federate-int - This code indicates that
            documents from the .participatingOrganization are available
            to organizations within the network by communicating with
            the network Initiating Gateway operated by .organization. In
            this context, "within the network" means organizations that
            have an HIEInitiator relationship with the .organization.
            This code is similar to the DocShare-federate code in mCSD,
            but is limited in scope to Organizations internal to the
            network.</li>
            <li>DocShare-federate-ext - This code indicates that
            documents from the .participatingOrganization are available
            to organizations outside of the network by communicating
            with the network Responding Gateway operated by
            .organization. In this context, "outside the network" means
            organizations that do not have a child relationship with the
            .organization, but do have upper level network or peer
            connectivity with that Organization. This code is similar to
            the DocShare-federate code in mCSD, but is limited in scope
            to Organizations external to the network.</li>
            <li>Other codes are used to indicate relationships
            irrelevant to document sharing access.</li>

            Representation of a single Organization's Endpoint in a
            directory</h4>
            <p>In a Single Organization Community, the Community can be
            represented as a single Organization resource with an
            Organization identifier and a Home Community ID, and these
            identifiers might even be the same. Since the Community's
            Responding Gateway serves a single Organization, Endpoints
            for each service provided by the Responding Gateway can be
            tied directly to the Organization resource, using the
            Organization.endpoint element.</p>
            <p>An Organization might manage its own Endpoint. This
            results the the simplest case shown below:</p>

            <p>Suppose instead Organization A is a subsidiary of its
            parent, B. B provides IT services and support to its
            subsidiaries, but each subsidiary has a unique document
            sharing endpoint that behaves identically to if it had
            hosted its own endpoint. The Endpoint is pointed at by
            Organization A to communicate that the Endpoint is logically
            "owned by" A, while it points to B as the
            managingOrganization to indicate that B is providing
            technical support for the endpoint:</p>

            <p>Suppose a similar relationship between organizations C
            and D, but where D is not a parent organization to C, rather
            it is a third party affiliate that provides IT services and
            support. In that case, the OrganizationAffiliation Resource
            might be used to convey the relationship rather than
            Organization.partOf:</p>

            <p>Another similar relationship between E and F might exist,
            but E handles network support for its own endpoint. In that
            case, E is still the managing organization, and F need not
            be represented in the directory at all:</p>

            <p>A single Organization might have multiple Endpoints for
            different purposes. For example, endpoints might be needed
            for IHE XCPD, XCA, XCDR, and a FHIR endpoint to accommodate
            PDQm and MHD transactions.</p>

            <p>This example does not specify the specificType extension
            for the RESTful FHIR endpoint because the needed information
            can be retrieved by retrieving the Organization's
            CapabilityStatement. However, one might choose to publish a
            list of supported FHIR profiles on the FHIR endpoint so that
            that information is available in the directory.</p>

            Representing Network Membership and Connectivity</h4>
            <p>Suppose Organization H is the governing organization for
            a Health Information Exchange Network, in which G is a
            member. Organization G hosts its own document sharing
            endpoint for access to its healthcare data by other members
            of H.</p>
            <p>We will represent this situation by using an
            OrganizationAffiliation resource with a code of
            "HIEResponder" to indicate this fact to other members in the
            directory.<br />
            If the endpoint were to be pointed to by the Organization H
            resource, it is not clear that data for H would not be
            returned by that endpoint, and H might have multiple
            affiliated organizations for which it needs to provide
            endpoints. Pointing at G's endpoint from G's Organization
            resource is more aligned with what is commonly done today,
            but would only work unambiguously if the directory is
            purpose built such that it is assumed that all endpoints are
            accessible to members of H. However, if G needs multiple
            endpoints to support different affiliated organizations that
            provide access to it, then it would be challenging to
            differentiate the different endpoints attached to G. In this
            example, OrganizationAffiliation allows the Endpoint to be
            declared specific to G while still making it clear that it
            is accessible by Initiators on H's network.</p>

            With Access Provided By Affiliation</strong></p>
            <p>Note that in this case, while the endpoint is specific to
            G, it is hosted by H as indicated by the
            managingOrganization link. However, since a client does not
            care that H manages the endpoint, only that it is used to
            access G and that members of H are authorized to use it. A
            client would not generally use the .managingOrganization
            link for functional purposes, except to provide information
            to end users in the event IT assistance is needed from H.
            This is an example of a case where H is acting as a
            proxy.</p>

            <p>An organization might be a member of, and reachable by,
            multiple networks. If each network exposes an Organization
            specific endpoint to the Organization, then they must list
            those endpoints on the OrganizationAffiliation Resource.
            Since each OrganizationAffiliation resource points to the
            appropriate network in .organization, it is clear to clients
            what credentials are needed for each endpoint.</p>

            system, such as is the case with departments, then the
            simplicity of .partOf might be beneficial instead of using
            OrganizationAffiliation.</p>

            using OrganizationAffiliation instead of partOf to declare
            the relationship. This might be more appropriate where
            Organizations AA and AB are subsidiaries that have some
            independent capabilities apart from Organization A, but
            still share IT resources. Here, the DocShare-federate codes

            <p>Directories that will have Organizations with partOf
            relationships where both Organizations have endpoints should
            have a way to distinguish whether the parent endpoint
            provides access to data from the child. Since
            OrganizationAffiliation might be used to represent several
            kinds of hierarchies, directory policy will dictate when
            OrganizationAffiliation implies document sharing access.
            OrganizationAffiliation and partOf might be used to indicate
            relationships outside of document sharing access according
            to directory policy, or directory policy might forbid
            that.</p>
            <p>Suppose a directory policy stated that parent

            when linked by an OrganizationAffiliation Resource where

            <p>If Organization A did provide document sharing access to
            Organization AA, then an explicit OrganizationAffiliation
            with code=DocShare-federate-int would be declared:</p>

            <p>In a multi-layered network, it is likely that different
            solutions will be used at different levels. Here,
            Organization J has three subsidiaries, Organizations JA, JB,
            and JC, as well as a document sharing affiliation with
            Organization I. Suppose the directory policy stated that
            document sharing access could be assumed when there was an
            OrganizationAffiliation relationship with
            OrganizationAffiliation.code=DocShare-federate-int or when
            Organization.partOf was the only path to a parent
            organization. Then, if Organization I's endpoint would
            provide document sharing access to all four organizations,
            it would be represented as so in the directory:</p>

            <h3 id="424-endpoint-discovery">4.2.4 Endpoint
            Discovery</h3>
            <p>One of the necessary goals of designing a directory
            structure should be to enable consumers to programmatically
            determine who they can communicate with and which
            communication endpoints they can use to do so. Following the
            example directory structure outlined above, the following
            pair of algorithms could be implemented by a Care Services
            Selective Consumer to navigate the directory. The first
            algorithm - the Network Access Endpoint Discovery Algorithm
            - is used to locate an endpoint that can be used to access a
            higher level network. The second algorithm - the Service
            Provider Endpoint Discovery Algorithm - is used to locate
            the endpoint that should be used to send a request to a
            given service provider in the directory. The Service
            Provider Endpoint Discovery Algorithm could be a primary
            algorithm for locating the endpoint that a client needs to
            use to accomplish sending a message, and it uses the Network
            Access Endpoint Discovery Algorithm internally to resolve
            that answer.</p>
            <p>There are a few things to be noted about these
            algorithms. First, they use the term "suitable endpoint" to
            refer to an endpoint that has an appropriate type for the
            task at hand. Second, they assume the above example codes
            are used in the directory. Finally, these algorithms are for
            illustrative purposes only. They are not optimized, and they
            do not defend against programming hazards such as
            nonsensical data, infinite loops, etc. It is possible that
            with directory policies that constrain directory layout,
            these algorithms could be simplified.</p>

            <p>An important consideration when layering multiple
            networks is how different entities in the network will
            perceive the network. Care needs to be taken to ensure that
            network directories at each level accurately reflect the set
            of endpoints reachable by those members. For example,
            consider the multi-layered network diagram:</p>
            <p><img src="images/multi_layered_network.svg"
            alt="Multi-Layered Diagram" /></p>
            <p><strong>Figure 4.2.6-1: Multi-Layered Network
            Layout</strong></p>
            <p>Here:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The community with HCID 1.2.8 is a member of the Top
            Level Network</li>
            <li>The Lower Network A network is also a member of the Top
            Level Network</li>
            <li>The community with HCID 1.2.7 is a member of Lower
            Network A</li>
            <li>The community with HCID 1.2.6 is a member of Lower
            Network A</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will start at the top level and work our way down:</p>
            <p>The Top Level Network has two direct members, A and B.
            These two members can communicate directly with each other
            by using the directory and trust policies provided by the
            Top Level Network. However, each network cannot directly
            access the lower organizations in the network - they must
            use the network gateways for that access. In contrast, in
            Lower Network A, Communities 1.2.6 and 1.2.7 can communicate
            directly with one another, but to reach Community 1.2.8,
            they would communicate via the Lower Network A gateways.</p>
            <p>A combination of OrganizationAffiliation Resources would
            be used to complete this representation:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>An Organization at the top level represents the Upper
            Network. This Organization does not have any endpoints and
            does not directly facilitate exchange, but exists to
            represent the entity in charge of operating the upper
            network.</li>
            <li>The Lower Networks connect to the upper network via a
            pair of OrganizationAffiliation Resources. One
            OrganizationAffiliation Resource will have
            code="HIEResponder" and their upper network accessible
            endpoint to indicate that they will respond on the network.
            The other will have code "HIEInitiator" to indicate that
            they are a client on the upper network. Since both
            Organizations are both initiators and responders on upper
            network, they can access each other's endpoints.</li>
            <li>Within Lower Network A, four types of
            OrganizationAffiliation Resources are used
            <ul>
            <li>Those with code=DocShare-federate-ext indicate that
            Lower Network A's endpoint on the upper network provides
            access to documents from the two Organizations within. This
            would be used by Community 1.2.8 to access the Organizations
            in Lower Network A.</li>
            <li>Those with code=DocShare-federate-int indicate that
            Lower Network A's endpoint for its members provides access
            to documents from the Organizations within. In this case,
            since only Community 1.2.7 has this code, only Community
            1.2.7's documents will be returned by Lower Network A's
            Initiating Gateway when queried from within the
            network.</li>
            <li>Those with code=HIEInitiator and HIEResponder act as
            they do on the upper network, but scoped to the lower
            network. In other words, they indicate that both members of
            Lower Network A can access each other's corresponding
            endpoints.</li>
            </ul></li>

            Inclusion of Push Recipient Addresses</h3>
            <p>A common need in document sharing push workflows is to
            deliver a message to a specific intended recipient. That
            recipient might be an Organization, a Practitioner, or some
            other Person or Group. Since the intended recipient of a
            message is often far more specific than the set of entities
            served by an endpoint, delivering a message to an endpoint
            is insufficient for push workflows - the recipient also
            needs to be addressed so that the message can be routed to
            the intended recipient.</p>
            <p>The IHE document sharing profiles capable of handling
            push messaging - XDR, XCDR, and MHD - contain a field for
            intendedRecipient that can be used for such an address. The
            appropriate value with which to populate intendedRecipient
            could be determined from the target recipient's entry in the
            mCSD directory. Note: For Practitioners, the
            PractitionerRole Resource would be the target resource since
            a Practitioner might have roles at several organizations,
            and it is important to deliver the message to the
            Practitioner at the Organization where the relevant patient
            care takes place. There are two elements, common across the
            FHIR resources that users would typically wish to address,
            that might be used for such a value:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>PractitionerRole, Location, and Organization Resources
            have endpoint elements. Endpoint.address can be any URI, so
            a URI could be constructed for each addressable resource,
            populated in intendedRecipient, and used by responding
            gateways for message routing.</li>
            <li>The above Resources, as well as the Person Resource,
            have a .telecom element. If these elements are populated
            with sufficiently unique values (for example, non-shared
            email addresses), then they could be used to populate
            intendedRecipient and used by responding gateways for
            message routing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additional profiling of the above Resources might specify
            a more standardized way of communicating intendedRecipient
            addresses in the future. In the absence of that profiling,
            determining how to populate intendedRecipient will be up to
            community and network policy. Networks that wish to enable
            the push model of exchange should ensure that whatever
            values they select can be used by responding gateways to the
            actual intended recipient.</p>
            <p>In an environment where suitable intendedRecipient
            addresses can be determined, a Document Source (or delegated
            Initiating Gateway) would accomplish pushing to the
            recipient by doing the following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>First, use the Endpoint Discovery Algorithm to find the
            most localized and suitable Endpoint for push messaging to
            the intended recipient's Organization.</li>
            <li>Then, compose a message with intendedRecipient populated
            according to community or network policy, and transmit that
            message to the discovered Endpoint.</li>
            </ul>

            Associating Documents With Directory Entries</h3>
            <p>A common need in document sharing is to attribute a
            received document to a healthcare organization or provider.
            This can be done discretely with the aid of a centralized
            directory. Both the authorInstitution and authorPerson
            document sharing metadata elements can contain a discrete
            identifier for the document's author. The corresponding mCSD
            directory entries will also have a .identifier element that
            discretely identifies them. Therefore, the authorInstitution
            and authorPerson document sharing metadata elements should
            be populated with identifiers from the corresponding
            directory entries to enable correlation.</p>
            <p>Note that Organizational identifiers like Home Community
            ID or Repository Unique ID are often not unique to a
            particular Organization and so should not be relied upon to
            attribute documents to a particular Organization.</p>
            <h2 id="43-example-directory-policies">4.3 Example Directory
            Policies</h2>
            <p>Directory policy will dictate the structure of the
            directory. In this section, several candidate policies are
            outlined to illustrate what a policy might look like and the
            effect that it has on the directory.</p>
            <h3 id="431-fully-comprehensive-directory">4.3.1 Fully
            Comprehensive Directory</h3>
            <p>In a fully comprehensive directory, Organization
            relationships are declared explicitly wherever possible.
            This ensures that multiple use cases and hierarchies can be
            represented in the directory, and new use cases can be added
            in the future with minimal chance of conflicting with the
            existing directory layout. The examples presented in this
            white paper would be aligned with this type of policy.</p>
            <p>This policy might look like the following:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>All Organizations known to users of the directory shall
            be published as Organization Resources</li>
            <li>The Organization that operates the directory shall be
            published as an Organization Resource</li>
            <li>The Organization that operates the top level network
            trust model shall be published as an Organization
            Resource</li>
            <li>Organization.partOf shall only be used when the child
            Organization is a legal subsidiary of the parent.</li>
            <li>Organization.partOf should not be used to indicate
            network connectivity or accessability. If that implication
            is desired, it shall only be assumed when there are no other
            routes to the partOf organization. The meaning of partOf as
            indicating a legal subsidiary shall be maintained in this
            case.</li>
            <li>Organization relationships other than legal subsidiary
            shall be represented using OrganizationAffiliation.</li>
            <li>The following is the value set for
            OrganizationAffiliation.code:
            <ul>
            <li>HIEInitiator - This code is used to indicate that the
            Organization linked in .participatingOrganization is a
            member of the network headed by the Organization in
            .organization, and it has permission and intent to request
            data from other members of the network. In this case,
            OrganizationAffiliation.endpoint represents the endpoint
            used by the .participatingOrganization to make requests of
            the Initiating Gateway under the authority of
            .organization.</li>
            <li>HIEResponder - This code is used to indicate that the
            Organization linked in .participatingOrganization is a
            member of the network headed by the Organization in
            .organization, and it has an Endpoint that accepts requests
            from other members of the network that have an HIEInitiator
            relationship with the network governing Organization. In
            this case, OrganizationAffiliation.endpoint contains
            endpoints used by other network members to send requests to
            .participatingOrganization. This Endpoint may also be used
            by Initiating and Responding gateways operated by the
            .organization.</li>
            <li>DocShare-federate-int - This code indicates that
            healthcare documents from the .participatingOrganization are
            available to organizations within the network by
            communicating with the network Initiating Gateway operated
            by .organization. In this context, "within the network"
            means organizations that have an HIEInitiator relationship
            with the .organization.</li>
            <li>DocShare-federate-ext - This code indicates that
            healthcare documents from the .participatingOrganization are
            available to organizations outside of the network by
            communicating with the network Responding Gateway operated
            by .organization. In this context, "outside the network"
            means organizations that do not have a child relationship
            with the .organization, but do have upper level network or
            peer connectivity with that Organization.</li>
            <li>MessagePush-federate-int - This code indicates that
            messages destined for recipients of
            .participatingOrganization can be successfully routed by
            .organization when originating within the network.</li>
            <li>MessagePush-federate-ext - This code indicates that
            messages destined for recipients of
            .participatingOrganization can be successfully routed by
            .organization when originating outside the network.</li>
            <li>Business-client - This code indicates that the
            .participatingOrganization is a business client of the
            .organization. Such relationships do not have implications
            on document sharing connectivity.</li>
            <li>Supplier - This code indicates that the
            .participatingOrganization receives supplies from the
            .organization. Such relationships do not have implications
            on document sharing connectivity.</li>
            <li>UnderJurisdiction - This code indicates that the
            .participatingOrganization is under the legal jurisdiction
            of the .organization. Such relationships do not have
            implications on document sharing connectivity.</li>
            <li>member - This code indicates a type of non-ownership
            relationship between entities (encompasses partnerships,
            collaboration, joint ventures, etc.)</li>
            <li>Other codes shall not be used</li>

            <li>If the Organization represents a community with a

            Directory</h3>
            <p>A directory might wish to ensure that there is only a
            single communication route between any two communication
            resources. Such a property might simplify the endpoint
            discovery algorithm, but makes managing the directory more
            difficult and potentially limits the use cases it can
            accommodate.</p>
            <p>Such a directory policy would be similar to the Fully
            Comprehensive Directory, but would have an additional policy
            that directory entries must be curated to ensure that only
            the optimal routes are represented.</p>
            <h3
            id="433-single-level-endpoint-directory-with-federation">4.3.3
            Single Level Endpoint Directory with Federation</h3>
            <p>A directory for a multi layered network might choose to
            only contain endpoints for Organizations at the top level.
            This would make sense if federation can be assumed at lower
            levels and lower levels had alternate mechanisms to discover
            endpoints within. The result of this is very simplistic
            endpoint discovery at the top level at the cost of directory
            flexibility.</p>
            <p>This directory might have the following policy:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Organizations at the top level network must be present
            in the directory</li>
            <li>Organizations at the top level store their endpoints at
            Organization.endpoint, and all endpoints are accessible to
            all other top level Organizations</li>
            <li>All other Organizations must have a partOf chain to the
            top level</li>
            <li>Top level Organizations must be able to provide document
            sharing access to all Organizations underneath</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that this policy precludes using the directory for
            any other purpose and will make it challenging to transition
            to a more comprehensive directory.</p>
            <p>The following are some of the use cases that might not be
            properly supported in such a directory:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Organizations that are accessible by multiple
            networks</li>
            <li>Organizations that have multiple systems within them
            that are accessible via disjoint networks</li>
            <li>Business relationships outside of network
            connectivity</li>
            </ul>

            Other Options To Simplify Directories</h3>
            <p>The comprehensive directory introduced in this white
            paper includes several features that might not need to be
            stored in the directory. Some examples include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Peer connectivity could be excluded in favor of out of
            band configuration</li>
            <li>Network participants might choose to configure the
            endpoints to access their network gateways rather than pull
            those endpoints from the directory</li>

            affiliated entities so that other network members can

            HIE, which provides a central service infrastructure that
            holds all clinical information for all organizations. This

            <p>Here’s Dr. Suwati using her EHR to do the search. Because
            the Organizations each have their own Endpoints, for the EHR
            to get documents from Urgent Health, it will need to expand
            its search to more than the known locations of treatment. In
            this case she will just search all Organizations in the
            HIE.</p>

            Network, Cross-community Access</h3>
            <p>In this example, we are showing the use case as
            cross-community access, as it is in Section 2. Valley HIE
            will now be a multi-community network, and each organization
            provides its own endpoints, which support cross-community
            profiles XCPD and XCA.</p>
            <p>If we have a purpose-built directory just for the members
            of Valley HIE, it could look like this:</p>

            <p>The first thing to notice is that this is no more complex
            than the previous example; we’re just up one level, and
            using cross-community profiles. A purpose-built directory
            supporting a single perspective can be very simple, and in
            fact, this is the typical directory structure in multiple
            nationwide exchanges.</p>
            <p>We’ve given each community a Home Community ID. Our
            examples show that while the OrgID and HCID can be related,
            there isn’t any required relationship. We also show that
            Urgent doesn’t support asynchronous transactions.</p>

            <p>Some networks route traffic through intermediaries that
            may be referred to as “proxying”. Here’s a network topology
            showing that for our use case:</p>

            <p>Now we’d like to represent disjoint (i.e., unconnected)
            communities in a single directory, as well as indicate
            organizational structure within communities. We will use
            this structure to indicate two things:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Which Endpoints can be accessed by which Organizations
            (note this is our first time showing multiple "perspectives"
            in this directory)</li>
            <li>How data from Organizations flows through those
            Endpoints</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We’ll start with our earlier simpler example, where the
            organizations in our use case are all in the same community
            with central services, but we’ll add another, unconnected
            community, Seaside HIE. In the directory we need to add
            Valley HIE as its own Organization, along with Seaside
            HIE.</p>
            <p>Valley and Seaside each get a Home Community ID (HCID) so
            they can be identified by other communities. We need a way
            for members of Valley Region HIE to find their services, and
            also to know that data flows through these services from the
            other organizations in the HIE. We could accomplish this
            with partOf relationships linking the organizations to the
            HIE:</p>

            Endpoints where data flows from the known locations of
            treatment, and due to the fact that Urgent Health happens to
            be in Valley HIE which uses central services, the documents
            from Urgent Health are included:</p>

            <p>But there are some cases that would cause this structure
            to break down. For example:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>We want to reserve partOf to reflect the organizations’
            real business relationships, which are unrelated to HIE
            membership.</li>
            <li>We want to show organizations that are in the HIE but
            not accessible at this time (i.e., data does not flow).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can solve these in a comprehensive directory by using
            OrganizationAffiliation to model the HIE membership instead,
            and using two mCSD defined codes: HIEInitiator to reflect
            Endpoints accessible by members of the HIE, and
            DocShare-federate-int to reflect that the affiliation
            supports federated document sharing through these Endpoints
            to its members. In other words, Endpoints belonging to the
            OrganizationAffiliation.organization will share documents
            from the OrganizationAffiliation.participatingOrganization
            federated organizations.</p>
            <p>In our example we can see that:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>All organizations affiliated with Valley HIE can access
            its central Endpoints.</li>
            <li>All organizations affiliated with Valley HIE except
            Valley Benefits share clinical documents.</li>
            <li>The local facility “Urgent Health Valley” is part of a
            nationwide chain, but this business relationship does not
            convey any document sharing meaning. Valley HIE will not
            share clinical documents from Urgent Health USA.</li>

            <p>In our comprehensive Document Access example, the full
            directory supports multiple perspectives, based on access.
            It does not rely on selective visibility based on the
            directory consumer’s perspective; all consumers can see all
            directory details.</p>
            <p>We have made some changes to our example to show these
            capabilities:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Valley Region HIE has joined a nationwide health
            information exchange, Big Health Exchange.</li>
            <li>Big Health Exchange doesn't have any central service
            endpoints; it is peer to peer.</li>
            <li>We've moved New Hope out of Valley HIE into Big Health
            to show how it can still access the desired organizations by
            virtue of Valley HIE's participation in Big Health. New Hope
            will get to these organizations through the endpoints
            "Valley BigHx Responding Gateway".</li>
            <li>For now, Valley HIE is leaving its PDQ and XDS internal
            service endpoints for its members, but has added initiating
            gateway endpoints for its members to access Big Health (as
            well as aggregate internal data).</li>
            <li>We added async endpoints and their response endpoints to
            show that even though members of Valley HIE utilize central
            services, they need individual async endpoints to receive
            responses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We’ve elided some details to make the diagram as simple
            as possible:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>We omitted Seaside HIE, as we've already shown how to
            reflect no connectivity.</li>
            <li>We omit New Hope’s Responding Gateway and internal
            details, since they aren’t involved in this Document Access
            example.</li>
            <li>We omit push-style endpoint connection types, since they
            aren’t involved in this Document Access example.</li>

            Practitioner at University Health. While Valley Access
            Healthcare and Urgent Health do not play a role in this use
            case, we still show them to illustrate the complexity that
            needs to be dealt with.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>New Hope Medical Partners is a participant of a network
            called "Big Health Exchange".</li>
            <li>Valley Access Healthcare, University Health, and Urgent
            Health are participants in a network called "Valley Region
            HIE".</li>
            <li>Both Big Health Exchange and Valley Region HIE are
            further members of a nationwide document sharing network to
            facilitate document sharing between members of both
            exchanges.</li>
            <li>Dr. Santos practices for University Health. As a result,
            a message to be read by Dr. Santos needs to be transmitted
            to University Health's EMR system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Taking the full picture from the previous use case, this
            yields the following diagram:</p>

            <p>Note that the diagram has omitted details not relevant to
            the push route to Dr. Santos from New Hope Medical
            Partners.</p>
            <p>In this example, the route from New Hope Medical Partners
            to Dr. Santos is via Valley Region HIE (via Big Health
            Exchange) to University Health. New Hope Medical Partners
            will send the message to Valley Region HIE with an intended
            recipient of "<a
            href="mailto:dr.santos@universityhealth.org">dr.santos@universityhealth.org</a>".
            Both Valley Region HIE and University Health can conclude
            that the message should be delivered to Dr. Santos by
            matching that up to his email address in the directory.</p>

            <h2 id="61-open-issues">6.1 Open Issues</h2>
            <p>Industry feedback is sought regarding the following
            issues:</p>
            <h3 id="611-use-of-organization-affiliation">6.1.1 Use of
            Organization Affiliation</h3>
            <p>This solutions proposed here make heavy use of
            OrganizationAffiliation connections between Organizations to
            define explicit relationships and signal Endpoint
            connectivity. This heavy use of OrganizationAffiliation
            might be seen as rather cumbersome to maintain, and so more
            elegant solutions might be appealing.</p>
            <p>One alternative would be to simply attach all endpoints
            to the Organization to which they belong, and use extensions
            to identify to which network clients the endpoints will
            allow access. In the case of intermediary federation,
            endpoints might encode the child organization to allow
            routing. This solution has a drawback in that a client
            cannot discover what Organization it is actually querying
            for information. This means it might get back results that
            were broader than it expected, or it might repeat searches
            where a single search to the responding gateway might have
            returned the needed results.</p>
            <p>A slightly less intrusive alternative would be to specify
            that endpoints on Organization may be used by child
            Organizations but not by others. This would reduce the
            number of OrganizationAffiliation Resources by removing the
            need for the HIEInitiator Resources. However, this solution
            does not make explicit the accessability of the endpoints
            used to initiate communication to the higher levels, nor
            does it make explicit which Organizations have permission to
            initiate requests in the network. In the case of networks
            that have Organizations which respond to requests for
            information but may not initiate, it is not possible to
            determine which Organizations may initiate without the
            HIEInitiator code.</p>

            Opportunities To Define and Enhance Standards</h2>
            <p>In the process of writing this white paper, there were a
            number of opportunities to improve existing or create new
            standards that have been identified. This section outlines
            those identified opportunities.</p>
            <h3 id="621-value-set-for-organizationaffiliationcode">6.2.1
            Value-Set for OrganizationAffiliation.code</h3>
            <p>The examples in this white paper illustrate the use of
            several codes that would be found within the value set for
            OrganizationAffiliation.code. Today, the mCSD Organization
            Affiliation Types ValueSet includes only a single code in
            addition to the base FHIR specification -
            DocShare-federate.</p>
            <p>We would propose a number of additional codes be added to
            support the capabilities desired in this white paper.</p>
            <h4 id="6211-partnerconnectivity">6.2.1.1
            PartnerConnectivity</h4>
            <p>The purpose of a PartnerConnectivity code would be to
            indicate direct peer connectivity between two Organizations.
            While we might expect such information be stored as
            configuration in the two peers rather than in a central
            directory, we think that having such a code is useful for
            being able to establish a complete directory.</p>
            <h4 id="6212-hieinitiator-and-hieresponder">6.2.1.2
            HIEInitiator and HIEResponder</h4>
            <p>The purpose of these codes would be to indicate an
            Organization's direct participation in the network
            symbolized by its parent Organization. In this situation,
            the HIEInitiator code would indicate that the Organization
            will initiate requests in such a network, while the
            HIEResponder code would indicate that it can respond to such
            requests from other members.</p>
            <h4 id="6213-docshare-federate">6.2.1.3
            DocShare-federate</h4>
            <p>The DocShare-federate code was added to mCSD to indicate
            that a parent Organization might serve requests for a linked
            child Organization. However, there are a number of
            assumptions here that might require the current code to be
            expanded into a number of sub-codes:</p>
            <h5 id="62131-internal-vs-external-federation">6.2.1.3.1
            Internal vs External Federation</h5>
            <p>With a single code, it must be assumed that the parent
            Organization's system (represented by the linked Endpoints)
            will return data from the linked children regardless of
            where the requests originates from. This is insufficient, as
            the system might actually only have the capability to return
            results for certain clients.</p>
            <p>One example is a network responding gateway that is only
            willing to perform federation services for clients external
            to the network. This would be a likely implementation
            decision in the case where it is expected that network
            members get data directly from one another rather than via
            the gateway. In this situation, perhaps the responding
            gateway exists to provide access to external clients, and
            the operators wish to keep operating costs to a minimum.</p>
            <p>A network responding gateway might likewise only be
            willing to federate requests sourced from internal clients.
            Such a policy might be desirable if the network gateway
            generally federates requests for internal clients, and a
            particular data source has not agreed to a policy to release
            data outside the network.</p>
            <p>To facilitate the need to represent this information in
            an mCSD directory, we propose that a more comprehensive
            Value-Set would differentiate between federation internal
            and external to a network.</p>
            <h5 id="62132-push-vs-pull">6.2.1.3.2 "Push" vs "Pull"</h5>
            <p>In comprehensive networks, it is likely that network
            members will have use cases for both data query and retrieve
            ("pull") and message delivery/"push" use cases. However,
            network gateways might be capable of federating only one
            type of use case. To accommodate a need to represent that in
            an mCSD directory, we propose defining separate codes for
            each of these use cases.</p>
            <h5
            id="62133-differences-for-each-standard-or-integration-profile">6.2.1.3.3
            Differences For Each Standard or Integration Profile</h5>
            <p>Finally, we anticipate that a particular network gateway
            might have endpoints compatible with several exchange
            standards or IHE integration profiles, but have different
            federation capabilities for each standard. This might be the
            case if the different standards or integration profiles are
            actually implemented by different IT systems operated by the
            Organization, and those systems have differing levels of
            interoperability with network members. To accommodate the
            need to represent this in an mCSD directory, we propose
            introducing distinct federation codes for each IHE
            integration profile to which federation across a network
            might apply, and for anticipated non-IHE standards. The
            resulting Value-Set should be extensible to allow for
            deployments to implement protocols not anticipated by
            IHE.</p>

            Normative Requirements Consistent With This Guidance</h3>
            <p>This white paper proposes strategies that can be used to
            manage a complex, multi-layered network and represent it in
            a centralized directory, with the mCSD integration profile
            being the basis of the directory used in examples. It would
            be potentially useful for IHE's suite of integration
            profiles to specify normative, testable requirements for
            implementations to align with. Such requirements might take
            the form of either content profiles on the mCSD directory
            contents and optional endpoint discovery requirements for
            Care Services Selective Consumer Actors.</p>

            Additional Targeting Capabilities in Cross Community
            Profiles</h3>
            <p>The use cases and examples in this white paper assume
            and/or imply that when a data consumer is searching for and
            requesting data from a data provider, it is generally
            interested in casting a wide net and thus receiving data
            from all available data providers. However, a consumer might
            wish to target only a single data provider where the source
            of the needed data is known. Targeting a single data
            provider would reduce the computational burden of searching
            for data across non-targeted providers as well as for the
            consumer.</p>
            <p>There is opportunity to improve the targeting guidance in
            the IHE XCPD and XCA integration profiles. In XCPD, many
            deployments today use the device receiver ID to target a
            patient discovery request to a single community, and some
            initiating and responding gateways respect that behavior.
            However, this behavior is not actually defined in the XCPD
            integration profile. Defining such behavior would benefit
            deployments that have this need, thus improving
            interoperability.</p>
            <p>With respect to XCA, queries are generally targeted to
            either a home community or to a patient identifier. While it
            is unlikely that two communities would share patient ID
            assigning authorities, and thus the full patient identifier
            (including assigning authority) would uniquely target a
            community, this is not a guarantee. More importantly, the
            directory model outlined in this white paper does not
            suggest a mechanism to associate an assigning authority with
            a responding gateway. Thus, and XCA initiating gateway might
            not have a mechanism to determine which community should
            respond to a particular request. This could be alleviated by
            suggesting that document consumers should supply the home
            community ID of a patient identifier even in XCA query
            requests that contain a patient identifier, to facilitate
            message routing.</p>

            Use of Home Community IDs in IHE FHIR Integration
            Profiles</h3>
            <p>For network gateways that do not act as facade
            communities, the mechanisms described in this white paper
            rely on Home Community ID for message routing. Home
            Community ID is only defined for the IHE XCPD, XCA, and XCDR
            integration profiles, for Patient Discovery, Document Query
            and Retrieve, and Push use cases, respectively. Many
            deployments today are moving toward a FHIR based model of
            data exchange. In order to achieve federation following the
            same patterns outlined in this white paper, the IHE FHIR
            integration profiles would need to be enhanced to
            incorporate message routing. This might be done using the
            same patterns established in XCPD, XCA, and XCDR, or it
            might involve alternative solutions such as clever encoding
            of routing information inside of FHIR Resource IDs. Further
            exploration of this topic is needed.</p>

            Federated FHIR Data Exchange Outside of Document
            Sharing</h3>
            <p>The topics and guidance presented here are presented
            through the lense of exchanging healthcare data via document
            sharing. However, modern deployments are looking to move
            toward RESTful exchange of discrete healthcare data elements
            in the form of individual FHIR Resources, such as the
            exchange patterns profiled by the HL7 IPA Implementation
            Guide. The use of document sharing simplifies the federation
            scenarios by significantly limiting the number of individual
            artifacts that need to be exchanged and the linkages between
            artifacts. Exploration of FHIR RESTful data exchange is
            likely necessary to achieve a successful deployment.</p>
