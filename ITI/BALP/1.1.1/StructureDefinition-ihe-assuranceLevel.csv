In SAML this is [defined to be carried](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-authn-context-2.0-os.pdf) in the `saml:AuthnContextClassRef`, but may be carried elsewhere based on the use-case and profiling of SAML.

The Vocabulary is not defined here. Some sources of vocabulary:
- HL7 v3 [Security Trust Assurance ValueSet](https://terminology.hl7.org/3.0.0/ValueSet-v3-SecurityTrustAssuranceObservationValue.html). These include ISO-7498-2, NIST 800-63-1, and NIST-800-63-2.
