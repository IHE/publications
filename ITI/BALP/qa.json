  "description" : "The Basic Audit Log Patterns (BALP) Implementation Guide is a Content Profile that defines some basic and reusable AuditEvent patterns. This includes basic audit log profiles for FHIR RESTful operations to be used when there is not a more specific audit event defined. A focus is enabling Privacy centric AuditEvent logs that hold well formed indication of the Patient when they are the subject of the activity being recorded in the log. Where a more specific audit event can be defined it should be derived off of these basic patterns.",
