## BasicAudit Test Plan

This Test Plan page is a prototype. We expect the maturity of the content will improve over time. For now, we summarize high level testing scope and available tools. Comments are welcome.

## Introduction

Overall test plan leverages the Profiles and Examples shown on the [Artifacts Summary](artifacts.md). The [Profiles](artifacts.md#structures-resource-profiles) listed describe the constraints that would be adhered to by actors claiming conformance to this implementation guide. Thus, any applicable AuditEvent Resources that are known to have been published by an app or server MUST be conformant to these profiles as appropriate.

The Examples listed in [Example Instances](artifacts.md#example-example-instances) are example instances. Some are conformant to the profiles. Other examples that either assist with the structure of the examples (e.g., Patient and Encounter) or are examples that should be able to handle in various ways.

This section will be filled in as the IHE Connectathon need drives the creation of the test plans, test procedures, test tools, and reporting.
