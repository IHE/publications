The Patient Demographics Consumer MAY support either or both options. \r\n- Introduced the Match Operation Option on the Patient Demographics Supplier to declare support for the ITI-119 transaction. The ITI-78 transaction remains REQUIRED on all Patient Demographics Suppliers. \r\n- Updated the PDQm Patient Profile to require business identifiers and align with requirements from [IPA Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/STU1/StructureDefinition-ipa-patient.html).\r\n- Added requirements for which combinations of search parameters shall be supported by Patient Demographics consumers in section 2:3.78.4.1.2.1.1. \r\n- Added recommended response patterns for handling deprecated patient identifies to sections 2:3.78.4.1.3 and 2:3.78.4.3.3. \r\n- Updated conformance language to conform to BCP 14.\r\n- Other minor updates for clarity and conciseness.",
