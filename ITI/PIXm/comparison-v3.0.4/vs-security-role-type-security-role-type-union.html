<h2>Union of http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/security-role-type and http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/security-role-type</h2>

  This is the ValueSet that contains all the codes in SecurityRoleType (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/security-role-type) and SecurityRoleType (http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/security-role-type). E.g. what you have to deal with if you get resources containing codes in either of them
