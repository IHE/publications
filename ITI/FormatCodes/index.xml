	<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
	FormatCode is a metadata element for identifying the technical format that a document follows. This is related to mime-type, but is more specific to the content requirements than the encoding requirement. Therefore a document following a FormatCode may have many mime-type encodings. The FormatCode is also related to the document type (e.g. LOINC document type), but is more specific to the requirements of the content.
