  "description" : "Request to book a selected Appointment. This operation follows the appointment availability and optional hold interactions.  This operation completes the booking of an appointment.  The server determines if the nominated appointment is still available (i.e., all the required actors and physical assets needed for the appointment are still available) and either accepts or rejects the book request and updates the resource status accordingly. \n\n In addition to the booking an appointment, this operation can also request to modify or cancel an existing appointment. \n\n### Book a New Appointment\n When booking a new appoint, the operation SHALL have either an `appointment-reference` or an `appointment-resource` parameter. If the `appointment-resource` parameter is used, the value of `Appointment.status` SHALL have the value of `pending`.\n\nA successful new appointment `$book` operation returns an [IHE ITI Appointment](./StructureDefinition-ihe-sched-appt.html) resource with the the value of `Appointment.status` set to `booked`.\n\n### Modify an Existing Appointment\n When requesting a modification of an existing appointment, the operation SHALL have an `appointment-resource` parameter and the value of `Appointment.status` SHALL have the value of `booked`.\n\nA successful request to modify an existing modification returns an [IHE ITI Appointment](./StructureDefinition-ihe-sched-appt.html) resource with the the value of `Appointment.status` set to `booked` and the changes that were requested correspondingly reflected in the resource.\n\n### Cancel an Existing Appointment  \n When requesting a cancellation of an existing appointment, the operation SHALL have an `appointment-resource` parameter and the value of `Appointment.status` SHALL have the value of `cancelled`.\n\nA successful request to cancel an existing modification returns an [IHE ITI Appointment](./StructureDefinition-ihe-sched-appt.html) resource with the the value of `Appointment.status` set to `cancelled`\n\n ",
