    <p>
      The Document Digital Signature (DSG) Profile defines general purpose methods
        of digitally signing of documents for communication and persistence. Among other uses, these
        methods can be used within an IHE <ins><a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/HIE-Whitepaper/index.html">Document Sharing</a></ins> <del>Document Sharing</del>
        infrastructure <del>(e.g., XDS, XCA, XDM, XDR, and MHD)</del>. There are three methods of digital
        signature defined here: Enveloping, Detached (manifest), and SubmissionSet.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet-list1">An Enveloping Signature is a Digital Signature Document that contains
        both the signature <del>block</del> and the content that is signed. Access to the contained content is
        through removing the Enveloping - Digital Signature.
        Among other uses, this method should not be used with Document Sharing infrastructure.</li>
      <li class="bullet-list1">A Detached Signature is a Digital Signature Document that contains a
        manifest that points at independently managed content. Detached signatures leave the signed
        document or documents in the original form. Among other
        uses, this method is recommended for use with a Document Sharing infrastructure to support
        Digital Signatures, as this method does not modify the original Document Content. This method
        uses the Document Sharing "SIGNS" relationship provides
        linkage.</li>
      <li class="bullet-list1">A SubmissionSet Signature is a Detached Signature Document that attests
        to the content in a <del>SubmissionSet</del> <ins><a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume3/ch-4.2.html#4.2.1.2">SubmissionSet</a></ins> by: containing a manifest of all the other Documents included
        in the SubmissionSet, and a reference to the
        SubmissionSet. The Document Sharing "SIGNS" relationship may be used but is not required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ink-on-paper signatures have been a part of the documentation process in health care and have
      traditionally been indicators of accountability. Reliable exchange and storage of electronic data
      between disparate systems requires a standard that
      implements equivalent non-repudiation to prevent document creators from denying authorship and
      rejecting responsibility.</p>

    <h2 id="37.4">37.4 Document Digital Signatures Profile Overview</h2>
    <p>The purpose of digital signatures in healthcare can vary greatly and it is important to
      understand the distinct use cases. A Digital Signature is a standards-based method to assure
      content integrity, authenticity, and authentication of the
      identity of the signer. The identity of the signer is assured through use of Private Key and
      Public Key management. Management of Private Key and Public Keys are not addressed by this
      profile. 
      <ins>The date/time of when the signature happened is critical to proving the sequence of the data over time. 
      For a discussion on Private Key and Public Key management (PKI), and assurance of time, see the <a href="ch-37.html#37.5">Security Considerations</a> section.</ins></p>
      <ins><p>The outcome is a new Document (the signature). The Metadata for the signature document 
        also has a <code>signs</code> relationship to the signed document(s). 
        Figure 37.4-1 shows this relationship.</p>
        <div id="f37.4-1">
          <img src="media/Figure_37.4-1.png" alt="DSG Document and Signature Relationship" />
          <p class="figureTitle">Figure 37.4-1: DSG Document and Signature Relationship</p>
        </div>
      </ins>

      <h3 id="37.4.1">37.4.1 Verify Document Integrity</h3>
    <p>One purpose of use of a Digital Signature is to verify that the document being used is the same
      as the document that was signed and has not been modified by error or intent. This is called
      establishing document integrity. Document signatures
      may be used to establish document integrity; that is, to verify that the current document is the
      same as the signed document, and it has not been modified by error or intent. Document signatures
      may also be used to ascertain the identity of
      the signer and the reason for signing.</p>
    <p>For example, to confirm that a document is a true copy of a source medical document, the digital
      signature is checked. If the signature is verified, then the document is a true copy. If the
      signature does not verify, then the document has
      been modified.</p>
    <p>Another purpose of use is to verify the clinical content of a document. When a physician has
      verified that a report is complete and correct, the physician signs the document with purpose of
      signature being "verification". If there is ever a
      need, the digital signature provides a mechanism to show that the "verification" was attested to
      by the physician.</p>
    <p>For example, a clinician who needs to rely on a document which was created by another clinician
      may use a signature to ascertain that the version they are using has been verified.</p>
    <h3 id="37.4.2">37.4.2 One Signature signing multiple documents</h3>
    <p>The Detached Signature Option supports a single signature document that simultaneously signs
      multiple documents. For example, when a doctor verifies and signs a diagnostic report, the
      digital signature can also sign the source data that was
      used to prepare the diagnostic report. The digital signature for a mammography diagnostic report
      may sign:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet-list1">The examination procedure notes</li>
      <li class="bullet-list1">The DICOM Mammography images that were read by the radiologist</li>
      <li class="bullet-list1">The verified diagnostic report</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This signature indicates more than that the diagnostic report is complete and correct. It also
      indicates the data that was examined and can detect whether that data is subsequently modified or
      damaged. Further, it indicates the extent of the
      data used. If there are also other reports in the XDS Document Registry, e.g., a later lab
      report, the digital signature indicates that this other information not used to prepare the
      report.</p>
    <h4 id="37.4.2.1">37.4.2.1 Signing a SubmissionSet</h4>
    <p>A variant of a Signature signing multiple documents is one where the group of documents being
      signed is also defined by a Document Sharing SubmissionSet.</p>
    <h3 id="37.4.3">37.4.3 Processing by <del>XDS</del> Document Consumer</h3>
    <p>Among other uses, the Detached Signature Option supports use of <ins><a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/HIE-Whitepaper/index.html">Document Sharing</a></ins> <del>Document Sharing</del> infrastructure <del>(e.g., XDS, XDR, XDM, and XCA)</del>
      . The following sections describe how common queries can be
      performed in a Document Sharing environment where
      document digital signatures are used. <ins>Additional details about the Document Sharing infrastructure are described in the <a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/HIE-Whitepaper/index.html">HIE Whitepaper</a></ins></p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet-list1">
        Search for signatures, given a document
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="indent">The signatures that apply to a specific document can be found by querying (e.g.,
      the XDS Document Registry) to obtain the "SIGNS" association linkages to that specific document.
      The "SIGNS" associations link the Digital Signature documents with the documents signed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet-list1">
        Search for documents, given a signature
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="indent">The signature document itself contains a manifest that lists the document IDs for
      all of the signed documents. It might also contain a SubmissionSet uniqueId for a submission set.
      The documents can be obtained through the Document Sharing system. It is possible that
      authorization or other limits may prevent retrieval of some of these
      documents.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet-list1">
        Search for signatures
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="indent">The signature documents are identified as a digital signature. This can be used
      to query for digital signatures in a time range, for specific patient, etc. The signature purpose
      codes can be used to limit these signatures. For example, a query may choose to eliminate data
      integrity signatures and search only for clinician signatures.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet-list1">
        Ignore signature documents in query
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="indent">The digital signature type document can also be suppressed in queries that are
      intended to retrieve only source documents. In an environment with extensive use of data
      integrity, creation, verification, and other signatures there may be several signature documents
      for each source document. If signature documents are not suppressed
      then a query for clinical documents may also have distracting extra results returned for
      signatures.</p>

    <h3 id="37.4.4">37.4.4 Sign a document by Enveloping - Use Case Description</h3>

    <p>When a clinician needs to bind both a document and the signature into one document (for example,
      because there is no Document Sharing infrastructure to carry the document, the digital signature,
      and the association), then the Enveloping
      Signature Option needs to be used.</p>
    <p>The Enveloping Signature method encapsulates the signed document inside of the digital signature
      document. The result is one new document that is externally the signature document, and embedded
      inside that document is the document that is
      signed.</p>
    <p>Since it is unclear whether (or which) metadata should refer to the signed document or to the
      enveloping signature document, IHE does not specify metadata to be used for an Enveloping
      Signature document in a Document Sharing infrastructure.</p>
    
    <h3 id="37.4.5"><ins>37.4.5 Sign using both XML and JSON options</ins></h3>
      <p><ins>When the signer does not know which signature technology stack the validator is using, then the signer can choose to sign with both options; or the validator support both options</ins></p>

    <h2 id="37.5">37.5 Security Considerations</h2>
    <p>Digital Signatures rely on a Private Key / Public Key Management Infrastructure (aka PKI) that
      must exist and be configured. The definition and configuration of PKI is outside the scope of
      this document content profile. 
      <ins>PKI binds public keys with the respective identities of entities (like people and organizations). This binding is established through a process of registration and issuance of certificates at and by a certificate authority (CA). </ins>
      The PKI should adhere
      to ISO TS-17090 standards for PKI in healthcare.</p>
    <p>The Detached Signature Option allows for independent management of signature document and
      content documents; thus, there is a risk they will be made unavailable through revision or access
      control.</p>
    <p>Content Creator and Content Consumer shall be grouped with CT Time Client as Digital Signatures
      require a reliable date and time. There is a risk that the clock can be subverted, so operational
      controls should be used to audit clock
      modifications.</p>
    <ins><p>Content Creator implementing the JSON Detached Signature or the JSON Enveloping Signature Options shall have access to a Time Stamping Authority (TSA) Service that meets the JSON Signature <code>tstVD</code> requirement and local policy requirements for Time Stamping Authority.</p></ins>
    <p>Content Creator and Content Consumer should be grouped with ATNA Secure Node or Secure
      Application to record an Audit Message when a signature is created or validated.</p>
    <h2 id="37.6">37.6 Cross Profile Considerations</h2>
    <p>When used with a <ins><a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/HIE-Whitepaper/index.html">Document Sharing</a></ins> <del>Document Sharing</del> infrastructure <del>(e.g., XDS, XDR, XDM, or XCA)</del>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet-list1">
        <a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume3/ch-5.5.html#5.5.6">ITI TF-3: 5.5.6</a>

      </li>
      <li class="bullet-list1">The "SIGNS" association type is used to indicate relationship between
        signed documents and the signature document</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When no Document Sharing infrastructure is used, then the Enveloping Signature Option should be
      used.</p>
