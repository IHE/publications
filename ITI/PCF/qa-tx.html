This information may be disclosed by HIPAA Covered Entities without patient authorization for a research, public health, and operations purposes if conditions are met, which includes obtaining a signed data use agreement from the recipient. See 45 CFR Section 164.514.\r\n\r\nThis metadata indicates that the receiver may have an obligation to comply with a data use agreement with the discloser.

Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions. The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly. A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss. An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer. A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:* In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy. The policy holder may be the covered party, a relative of the covered party, a partnership, or a corporation, e.g., an employer. A subscriber of a self-insured health insurance policy is a policy holder. A subscriber of an employer sponsored health insurance policy is holds a certificate of coverage, but is not a policy holder; the policy holder is the employer.

A health insurance policy is a written contract for insurance between the insurance company and the policyholder, and contains pertinent facts about the policy owner (the policy holder), the health insurance coverage, the insured subscribers and dependents, and the insurer. Health insurance is typically administered in accordance with a plan, which specifies (1) the type of health services and health conditions that will be covered under what circumstances (e.g., exclusion of a pre-existing condition, service must be deemed medically necessary; service must not be experimental; service must provided in accordance with a protocol; drug must be on a formulary; service must be prior authorized; or be a referral from a primary care provider); (2) the type and affiliation of providers (e.g., only allopathic physicians, only in network, only providers employed by an HMO); (3) financial participations required of covered parties (e.g., co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, out-of-pocket); and (4) the manner in which services will be paid (e.g., under indemnity or fee-for-service health plans, the covered party typically pays out-of-pocket and then file a claim for reimbursement, while health plans that have contractual relationships with providers, i.e., network providers, typically do not allow the providers to bill the covered party for the cost of the service until after filing a claim with the payer and receiving reimbursement).</td><td/><td>22099</td><td>active</td><td>true</td><td/><td/><td>_ActInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DENTAL<a name=\"v3-ActCode-DENTAL\"> </a></td><td>dental care policy</td><td>**Definition:** A health insurance policy that that covers benefits for dental services.</td><td/><td>22105</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActHealthInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DISEASE<a name=\"v3-ActCode-DISEASE\"> </a></td><td>disease specific policy</td><td>**Definition:** A health insurance policy that covers benefits for healthcare services provided for named conditions under the policy, e.g., cancer, diabetes, or HIV-AIDS.</td><td/><td>22106</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActHealthInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DRUGPOL<a name=\"v3-ActCode-DRUGPOL\"> </a></td><td>drug policy</td><td>**Definition:** A health insurance policy that covers benefits for prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals, and supplies.</td><td/><td>22107</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActHealthInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HIP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-HIP\"> </a></td><td>health insurance plan policy</td><td>**Definition:** A health insurance policy that covers healthcare benefits by protecting covered parties from medical expenses arising from health conditions, sickness, or accidental injury as well as preventive care.

Use of non-participating providers often requires the covered party to pay the provider directly and then to file a claim for reimbursement, like in an FFS plan.</td><td/><td>22111</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActHealthInsuranceTypeCode, MCPOL</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SUBPOL<a name=\"v3-ActCode-SUBPOL\"> </a></td><td>substance use policy</td><td>**Definition:** A health insurance policy that covers benefits for substance use services.</td><td/><td>22114</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActHealthInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0VISPOL<a name=\"v3-ActCode-VISPOL\"> </a></td><td>vision care policy</td><td>**Definition:** Set of codes for a policy that provides coverage for health care expenses arising from vision services.\r\n\r\nA health insurance policy that covers benefits for vision care services, prescriptions, and products.</td><td/><td>22115</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActHealthInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"#v3-ActCode-EHCPOL\">EHCPOL</a></td><td>extended healthcare</td><td colspan=\"8\"/></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"#v3-ActCode-HSAPOL\">HSAPOL</a></td><td>health spending account</td><td colspan=\"8\"/></tr><tr><td>3</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DIS<a name=\"v3-ActCode-DIS\"> </a></td><td>disability insurance policy</td><td>**Definition:** An insurance policy that provides a regular payment to compensate for income lost due to the covered party's inability to work because of illness or injury.</td><td/><td>22102</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EWB<a name=\"v3-ActCode-EWB\"> </a></td><td>employee welfare benefit plan policy</td><td>**Definition:** An insurance policy under a benefit plan run by an employer or employee organization for the purpose of providing benefits other than pension-related to employees and their families.

In return, the policyholder agrees to pay a stipulated amount called a premium at regular intervals. Life insurance indemnifies the beneficiary for the loss of the insurable interest that a beneficiary has in the life of a covered party. For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:*A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).</td><td/><td>22148</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ANNU<a name=\"v3-ActCode-ANNU\"> </a></td><td>annuity policy</td><td>**Definition:** A policy that, after an initial premium or premiums, pays out a sum at pre-determined intervals.\r\n\r\nFor example, a policy holder may pay $10,000, and in return receive $150 each month until he dies; or $1,000 for each of 14 years or death benefits if he dies before the full term of the annuity has elapsed.</td><td/><td>22118</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>LIFE</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TLIFE<a name=\"v3-ActCode-TLIFE\"> </a></td><td>term life insurance policy</td><td>**Definition:** Life insurance under which the benefit is payable only if the insured dies during a specified period.

Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.\r\n\r\nFor example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000. A fire insurance company which issues a large policy generally reinsures a portion of the risk with one or several other companies.

Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them.

Where the Privacy Rule requires patient authorization, voluntary consent is not sufficient to permit a use or disclosure of protected health information unless it also satisfies the requirements of a valid authorization. An authorization is a detailed document that gives covered entities permission to use protected health information for specified purposes, which are generally other than treatment, payment, or health care operations, or to disclose protected health information to a third party specified by the individual.\r\n\r\nAn authorization must specify a number of elements, including a description of the protected health information to be used and disclosed, the person authorized to make the use or disclosure, the person to whom the covered entity may make the disclosure, an expiration date, and, in some cases, the purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed. With limited exceptions, covered entities may not condition treatment or coverage on the individual providing an authorization. https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/264/what-is-the-difference-between-consent-and-authorization/index.html\r\n\r\nA HIPAA Authorization must comply with 45 CFR Section164.508(c) Implementation specifications: Core elements and requirements â€“ (1) Core elements. A valid authorization under this Section must contain at least the following elements: (i) A description of the information to be used or disclosed that identifies the information in a specific and meaningful fashion. (ii) The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, authorized to make the requested use or disclosure. (iii) The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, to whom the covered entity may make the requested use or disclosure. (iv) A description of each purpose of the requested use or disclosure. The statement â€œat the request of the individualâ€? is a sufficient description of the purpose when an individual initiates the authorization and does not, or elects not to, provide a statement of the purpose. (v) An expiration date or an expiration event that relates to the individual or the purpose of the use or disclosure. The statement â€œend of the research study,â€? â€œnone,â€? or similar language is sufficient if the authorization is for a use or disclosure of protected health information for research, including for the creation and maintenance of a research database or research repository. (vi) Signature of the individual and date. If the authorization is signed by a personal representative of the individual, a description of such representative's authority to act for the individual must also be provided. (2)Required statements. In addition to the core elements, the authorization must contain statements adequate to place the individual on notice of all of the following: (i) The individual's right to revoke the authorization in writing, and either: (A) The exceptions to the right to revoke and a description of how the individual may revoke the authorization; or (B) To the extent that the information in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is included in the notice required by Section 164.520, a reference to the covered entity's notice. https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2017-title45-vol1/pdf/CFR-2017-title45-vol1-sec164-508.pdf\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* Used to indicate the legal authority for assigning security labels to HIPAA governed information.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description: Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles. A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy). These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine. A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy. When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information. This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements. For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain. 'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly. Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply. Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly. The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.</td><td/><td>23329</td><td>active</td><td>true</td><td/><td/><td>_ActPrivacyPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy<a name=\"v3-ActCode-_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy\"> </a></td><td>ActInformationSensitivityPolicy</td><td>Types of sensitivity policies that apply to Acts.

Unclassified Information (CUI) policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* In the US, CPLYCUI may be used as a security label code to inform recipients of information designated by a US Federal Agency as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, executive orders, and other guidances, such as included in DURSAs, to persist, mark, and enforce required CUI controls\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with US 32 CFR Part 2002 and US Executive Order 13556 Controlled Unclassified Information, US Federal Agencies and their contractors are charged with classifying and marking certain information they create as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).\r\n\r\nThe following definitions, which are provided for context, are based on terms defined by the CUI Glossary https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/cui-glossary.html\r\n\r\n *  CUI is defined as &quot;information in any form that the Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls.&quot;\r\n *  Designating CUI occurs when an authorized holder, consistent with 32 CFR Part 2002 and the CUI Registry, determines that a specific item of information falls into a CUI category or subcategory.\r\n *  The designating agency is the executive branch agency that designates or approves the designation of a specific item of information as CUI.\r\n *  The authorized holder who designates the CUI must make recipients aware of the information's CUI status when disseminating that information.\r\n *  â€¢ Disseminating occurs when authorized holders provide access, transmit, or transfer CUI to other authorized holders through any means, whether internal or external to the agency.\r\n\r\nOnce designated as CUI, US Federal Agencies and their contractors must assign CUI marks as prescribed by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) CUI Registry, and display marks as prescribed by the CUI Marking Handbook.\r\n\r\nCUI markings must be displayed on hard copy, on containers, electronic media, and to end users for IT systems.\r\n\r\nWhen HL7 content is designated as CUI, these computable markings can be interoperably conveyed using HL7 security label CUI tags, and may be included in HL7 text and narrative elements as human readable markings.\r\n\r\n**Impact of CUI markings:**\r\n\r\nCUI Custodians must enforce CUI security controls per applicable CUI policies. Federal agencies and their contractors must adhere to FISMA and NIST SP 800-53 security controls. Custodians, who are not Federal agencies or agency contractors, and are receivers of CUI, must adhere to NIST SP 800-171 security controls and those dictated by the Authorities indicated by the assigned CUI markings.\r\n\r\nFor most participants in US healthcare information exchange, including Federal Agencies and their contractors, additional controls are required by HIPAA Security standards for health information US 42 USC 1320d-2(d)(2) https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2016-title42/pdf/USCODE-2016-title42-chap7-subchapXI-partC-sec1320d-2.pdf\r\n\r\nFederal Agencies and their contractors may be the CUI classifier of original CUI content; or a CUI derivative classifier, which reclassifies CUI content that has been aggregated with other CUI or Unclassified Uncontrolled Information (U) or dissembled from a larger CUI content; or declassifiers, depending on the designating agency's policies.\r\n\r\nApplicable CUI policies include the following and any future applicable updates to policies or laws related to CUI:\r\n\r\n *  Executive Order 13556 https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/11/09/2010-28360/controlled-unclassified-information\r\n *  US 32 CFR Part 2002 https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2017-title32-vol6/pdf/CFR-2017-title32-vol6-part2002.pdf\r\n *  NIST SP 800-171 https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r1.pdf\r\n *  NIST SP 800-171A https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171A\r\n *  CUI Marking Handbook https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf\r\n *  CUI Registry - Health Information Category https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/category-detail/health-info\r\n *  CUI Registry: Limited Dissemination Controls https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/limited-dissemination\r\n *  CUI Policy and Guidance https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/policy-guidance</td><td/><td>24131</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CPLYJPP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-CPLYJPP\"> </a></td><td>comply with jurisdictional privacy policy</td><td>Custodian security system must retrieve, evaluate, and comply with applicable jurisdictional privacy policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* CPLYJPP may be used as a security label code to inform senders and receivers of information tagged with an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType\\_ActPrivacyPolicy\\_ActPrivacyLaw code or an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType\\_ActInformationPolicy.JurisIP code to comply with applicable jurisdictional privacy policy.</td><td/><td>23380</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CPLYJSP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-CPLYJSP\"> </a></td><td>comply with jurisdictional security policy</td><td>Custodian security system must retrieve, evaluate, and comply with applicable jurisdictional security policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* CPLYJSP may be used as a security label code to inform senders and receivers of information tagged with an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType.SecurityPolicy code to comply with applicable jurisdictional security policy.</td><td/><td>24130</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CPLYOPP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-CPLYOPP\"> </a></td><td>comply with organizational privacy policy</td><td>Custodian security system must retrieve, evaluate, and comply with applicable organizational privacy policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* CPLYOPP may be used as a security label code to inform senders and receivers of information tagged with an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType\\_ActInformationPolicy.OrgIP code to comply with applicable organizational privacy policy.</td><td/><td>23381</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CPLYOSP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-CPLYOSP\"> </a></td><td>comply with organizational security policy</td><td>Custodian security system must retrieve, evaluate, and comply with the organizational security policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* CPLYOSP may be used as a security label code to inform senders and receivers of information tagged with an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType.SecurityPolicy code to comply with applicable organizational security policy.</td><td/><td>23382</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DECLASSIFYLABEL<a name=\"v3-ActCode-DECLASSIFYLABEL\"> </a></td><td>declassify security label</td><td>Custodian security system must declassify information assigned security labels by instantiating a new version of the classified information so as to break the binding of the classifying security label when assigning a new security label that marks the information as unclassified in accordance with applicable jurisdictional privacy policies associated with the target information.

Related Security Control Observation named tag sets are Purpose of Use, Obligation Policy, and Refrain Policy, each with their own Security Control Observation Value tag sets.\r\n\r\nFoundational standard definitions: ISO 22600-3 Section A.3.4.3 - If present, the privacy-mark is not used for access control. The content of the privacy-mark may be defined by the security policy in force (identified by the security-policy-identifier) which may define a list of values to be used. Alternately, the value may be determined by the originator of the security-label. IEEE Security Glossary Compendium 93- CESG Memorandum No.1 Issue 1.2 Oct 1992 - Human readable word or phrase acting as an indicator of all or part of the security constraints that apply to a document so marked. NOTE: A machine readable representation of a marking.\r\n\r\n*Comment:* While policies requiring creators, processors, custodians, senders or recipients apply, enforce, and persist applicable Privacy Marks may be dictated by a jurisdiction, organization or personal privacy, security, or integrity policy, those required to comply may be governed under different policies, so compliance may need to be enforced through trust contracts. For example, information content marked with GDPR related policies may require adherence by processors or recipients outside of the European Union. For this reason, this code system is likely to evolve with the inclusion of multiple policy domains needing to communicate encoded policies in a standard, interoperable manner.</td><td/><td>24045</td><td>active</td><td>true</td><td/><td/><td>SecurityPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ControlledUnclassifiedInformation<a name=\"v3-ActCode-ControlledUnclassifiedInformation\"> </a></td><td>ControlledUnclassifiedInformation</td><td>Information the US Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls.

Agency heads may approve the required use of CUI Portion marking on all CUI generated within their agency. As such, users should consult their agency CUI policy when creating CUI documents. When CUI Portion Markings are used and a portion does not contain CUI a â€œUâ€? is placed in parentheses to indicate that the portion contains Uncontrolled Unclassified Information. (Page 14)\r\n\r\nCUI Portion Markings are placed at the beginning of the portion to which they apply and must be used throughout the entire document. They are presented in all capital letters and separated as indicated in this handbook and the CUI Registry. The presence of EVEN ONE item of CUI in a document requires CUI marking of that document. Because of this, CUI Portion Markings can be of great assistance in determining if a document contains CUI and therefore must be marked as such. Remember: When portion markings are used and any portion does not contain CUI, a â€œ(U)â€? is placed in front of that portion to indicate that it contains Uncontrolled - or non-CUI - Unclassified Information.

The federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record that identifies a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose (see Â§ 2.31). The federal rules restrict any use of the information to investigate or prosecute with regard to a crime any patient with a substance use disorder, except as provided at Â§Â§ 2.12(c)(5) and 2.65; or (2) 42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized disclosure of these records. https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/2.32\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* Example of marking requirement from SAMHSA FAQ Response to question 13:\r\n\r\nWould a logon or splash page notification on an HIOâ€™s portal that contains the Part 2 notice prohibiting redisclosure be sufficient to meet Part 2â€™s requirement that disclosures made with patient consent be accompanied by such a statement?\r\n\r\nNo. Part 2 requires each disclosure made with written patient consent to be accompanied by a written statement that the information disclosed is protected by federal law and that the recipient cannot make any further disclosure of it unless permitted by the regulations (42 CFR Â§ 2.32). A logon page is the page where a user logs onto a computer system; a splash page is an introductory page to a web site. A logon or splash page notification on a HIO's portal including the statement as required by Â§ 2.32 would not be sufficient notification regarding prohibitions on redisclosure since it would not accompany a specific disclosure. The notification must be tied to the Part 2 information being disclosed in order to ensure that the recipient of that information knows that specific information is protected by Part 2 and cannot be redisclosed except as authorized by the express written consent of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by Part 2. https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confidentiality-regulations-faqs</td><td/><td>24049</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>SecurityLabelMark</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RestrictedConfidentialityMark<a name=\"v3-ActCode-RestrictedConfidentialityMark\"> </a></td><td>restricted confidentiality mark</td><td>A displayed mark rendered to end users as &quot;Restricted Confidentiality&quot;, which indicates that the electronic or hardcopy information they are viewing, must be protected at a restricted level of confidentiality protection as defined by HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot; (restricted). Examples: Includes information that is additionally protected such as sensitive conditions mental health, HIV, substance abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, genetic disease, and reproductive health; or sensitive demographic information such as a patient's standing as an employee or a celebrity. Use cases include a display to alert authorized EHR users that they are viewing additionally protected health information deemed sensitive by an applicable jurisdictional, organizational, or personal privacy policy.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* The definition is based on HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot; (restricted), which is described as:\r\n\r\nPrivacy metadata indicating highly sensitive, potentially stigmatizing information, which presents a high risk to the information subject if disclosed without authorization. May be pre-empted by jurisdictional law, e.g., for public health reporting or emergency treatment. Foundational definitions of Confidentiality: From HL7 Confidentiality Concept Domain: Types of privacy metadata classifying an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) according to its level of sensitivity, which is based on an analysis of applicable privacy policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to an individual or entity that could result if made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.\r\n\r\nUsage Note from HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot;: Confidentiality codes may be used in security labels and privacy markings to classify IT resources based on sensitivity to indicate the obligation of a custodian or receiver to ensure that the protected resource is not made available or disclosed to individuals, entities, or processes (security principals) unless authorized per applicable policies. Confidentiality codes may also be used in the clearances of initiators requesting access to protected resources.\r\n\r\nThis metadata indicates that the receiver may be obligated to comply with applicable, prevailing (default) jurisdictional privacy law or disclosure authorization.\r\n\r\nMap: Definition aligns with ISO 7498-2:1989 - Confidentiality is the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (3) Clinical Care: Default for normal clinical care access (i.e. most clinical staff directly caring for the patient should be able to access nearly all of the EHR).

Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions. The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly. A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss. An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer. A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:* In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy. The policy holder may be the covered party, a relative of the covered party, a partnership, or a corporation, e.g., an employer. A subscriber of a self-insured health insurance policy is a policy holder. A subscriber of an employer sponsored health insurance policy is holds a certificate of coverage, but is not a policy holder; the policy holder is the employer.

A program is an organized structure for administering and funding coverage of a benefit package for covered parties meeting eligibility criteria, typically related to employment, health, financial, and demographic status. Programs are typically established or permitted by legislation with provisions for ongoing government oversight. Regulations may mandate the structure of the program, the manner in which it is funded and administered, covered benefits, provider types, eligibility criteria and financial participation. A government agency may be charged with implementing the program in accordance to the regulation. Risk of loss under a program in most cases would not meet what an underwriter would consider an insurable risk, i.e., the risk is not random in nature, not financially measurable, and likely requires subsidization with government funds.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:* Programs do not have policy holders or subscribers. Program eligibles are enrolled based on health status, statutory eligibility, financial status, or age. Program eligibles who are covered parties under the program may be referred to as members, beneficiaries, eligibles, or recipients. Programs risk are underwritten by not for profit organizations such as governmental entities, and the beneficiaries typically do not pay for any or some portion of the cost of coverage.

For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:*A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"active"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"22148"},{"code":"subsumedBy","valueCode":"_ActInsuranceTypeCode"}]},{"code":"PNC","display":"property and casualty insurance policy","definition":"**Definition:** A type of insurance that covers damage to or loss of the policyholderaTMs property by providing payments for damages to property damage or the injury or death of living subjects.

Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.\r\n\r\nFor example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description: Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles. A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy). These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine. A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy. When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information. This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements. For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain. 'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly. Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply. Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly. The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.","property":[{"code":"notSelectable","valueBoolean":true},{"code":"status","valueCode":"active"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"23329"},{"code":"subsumedBy","valueCode":"_ActPrivacyPolicy"}]},{"code":"COMPT","display":"compartment","definition":"This is the healthcare analog to the US Intelligence Community's concept of a Special Access Program.

Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions. The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly. A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss. An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer. A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:* In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy. The policy holder may be the covered party, a relative of the covered party, a partnership, or a corporation, e.g., an employer. A subscriber of a self-insured health insurance policy is a policy holder. A subscriber of an employer sponsored health insurance policy is holds a certificate of coverage, but is not a policy holder; the policy holder is the employer.

A health insurance policy is a written contract for insurance between the insurance company and the policyholder, and contains pertinent facts about the policy owner (the policy holder), the health insurance coverage, the insured subscribers and dependents, and the insurer. Health insurance is typically administered in accordance with a plan, which specifies (1) the type of health services and health conditions that will be covered under what circumstances (e.g., exclusion of a pre-existing condition, service must be deemed medically necessary; service must not be experimental; service must provided in accordance with a protocol; drug must be on a formulary; service must be prior authorized; or be a referral from a primary care provider); (2) the type and affiliation of providers (e.g., only allopathic physicians, only in network, only providers employed by an HMO); (3) financial participations required of covered parties (e.g., co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, out-of-pocket); and (4) the manner in which services will be paid (e.g., under indemnity or fee-for-service health plans, the covered party typically pays out-of-pocket and then file a claim for reimbursement, while health plans that have contractual relationships with providers, i.e., network providers, typically do not allow the providers to bill the covered party for the cost of the service until after filing a claim with the payer and receiving reimbursement).</td><td/><td>22099</td><td>active</td><td>true</td><td/><td/><td>_ActInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DENTAL<a name=\"v3-ActCode-DENTAL\"> </a></td><td>dental care policy</td><td>**Definition:** A health insurance policy that that covers benefits for dental services.</td><td/><td>22105</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActHealthInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DISEASE<a name=\"v3-ActCode-DISEASE\"> </a></td><td>disease specific policy</td><td>**Definition:** A health insurance policy that covers benefits for healthcare services provided for named conditions under the policy, e.g., cancer, diabetes, or HIV-AIDS.</td><td/><td>22106</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActHealthInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DRUGPOL<a name=\"v3-ActCode-DRUGPOL\"> </a></td><td>drug policy</td><td>**Definition:** A health insurance policy that covers benefits for prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals, and supplies.</td><td/><td>22107</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActHealthInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0HIP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-HIP\"> </a></td><td>health insurance plan policy</td><td>**Definition:** A health insurance policy that covers healthcare benefits by protecting covered parties from medical expenses arising from health conditions, sickness, or accidental injury as well as preventive care.

In return, the policyholder agrees to pay a stipulated amount called a premium at regular intervals. Life insurance indemnifies the beneficiary for the loss of the insurable interest that a beneficiary has in the life of a covered party. For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:*A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).</td><td/><td>22148</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>_ActInsuranceTypeCode</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ANNU<a name=\"v3-ActCode-ANNU\"> </a></td><td>annuity policy</td><td>**Definition:** A policy that, after an initial premium or premiums, pays out a sum at pre-determined intervals.\r\n\r\nFor example, a policy holder may pay $10,000, and in return receive $150 each month until he dies; or $1,000 for each of 14 years or death benefits if he dies before the full term of the annuity has elapsed.</td><td/><td>22118</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>LIFE</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TLIFE<a name=\"v3-ActCode-TLIFE\"> </a></td><td>term life insurance policy</td><td>**Definition:** Life insurance under which the benefit is payable only if the insured dies during a specified period.

Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.\r\n\r\nFor example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000. A fire insurance company which issues a large policy generally reinsures a portion of the risk with one or several other companies.

Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them.

Where the Privacy Rule requires patient authorization, voluntary consent is not sufficient to permit a use or disclosure of protected health information unless it also satisfies the requirements of a valid authorization. An authorization is a detailed document that gives covered entities permission to use protected health information for specified purposes, which are generally other than treatment, payment, or health care operations, or to disclose protected health information to a third party specified by the individual.\r\n\r\nAn authorization must specify a number of elements, including a description of the protected health information to be used and disclosed, the person authorized to make the use or disclosure, the person to whom the covered entity may make the disclosure, an expiration date, and, in some cases, the purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed. With limited exceptions, covered entities may not condition treatment or coverage on the individual providing an authorization. https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/264/what-is-the-difference-between-consent-and-authorization/index.html\r\n\r\nA HIPAA Authorization must comply with 45 CFR Section164.508(c) Implementation specifications: Core elements and requirements â€“ (1) Core elements. A valid authorization under this Section must contain at least the following elements: (i) A description of the information to be used or disclosed that identifies the information in a specific and meaningful fashion. (ii) The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, authorized to make the requested use or disclosure. (iii) The name or other specific identification of the person(s), or class of persons, to whom the covered entity may make the requested use or disclosure. (iv) A description of each purpose of the requested use or disclosure. The statement â€œat the request of the individualâ€? is a sufficient description of the purpose when an individual initiates the authorization and does not, or elects not to, provide a statement of the purpose. (v) An expiration date or an expiration event that relates to the individual or the purpose of the use or disclosure. The statement â€œend of the research study,â€? â€œnone,â€? or similar language is sufficient if the authorization is for a use or disclosure of protected health information for research, including for the creation and maintenance of a research database or research repository. (vi) Signature of the individual and date. If the authorization is signed by a personal representative of the individual, a description of such representative's authority to act for the individual must also be provided. (2)Required statements. In addition to the core elements, the authorization must contain statements adequate to place the individual on notice of all of the following: (i) The individual's right to revoke the authorization in writing, and either: (A) The exceptions to the right to revoke and a description of how the individual may revoke the authorization; or (B) To the extent that the information in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(A) of this section is included in the notice required by Section 164.520, a reference to the covered entity's notice. https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2017-title45-vol1/pdf/CFR-2017-title45-vol1-sec164-508.pdf\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* Used to indicate the legal authority for assigning security labels to HIPAA governed information.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description: Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles. A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy). These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine. A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy. When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information. This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements. For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain. 'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly. Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply. Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly. The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.</td><td/><td>23329</td><td>active</td><td>true</td><td/><td/><td>_ActPrivacyPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy<a name=\"v3-ActCode-_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy\"> </a></td><td>ActInformationSensitivityPolicy</td><td>Types of sensitivity policies that apply to Acts.

Unclassified Information (CUI) policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* In the US, CPLYCUI may be used as a security label code to inform recipients of information designated by a US Federal Agency as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, executive orders, and other guidances, such as included in DURSAs, to persist, mark, and enforce required CUI controls\r\n\r\nBackground:\r\n\r\nIn accordance with US 32 CFR Part 2002 and US Executive Order 13556 Controlled Unclassified Information, US Federal Agencies and their contractors are charged with classifying and marking certain information they create as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).\r\n\r\nThe following definitions, which are provided for context, are based on terms defined by the CUI Glossary https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/cui-glossary.html\r\n\r\n *  CUI is defined as &quot;information in any form that the Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls.&quot;\r\n *  Designating CUI occurs when an authorized holder, consistent with 32 CFR Part 2002 and the CUI Registry, determines that a specific item of information falls into a CUI category or subcategory.\r\n *  The designating agency is the executive branch agency that designates or approves the designation of a specific item of information as CUI.\r\n *  The authorized holder who designates the CUI must make recipients aware of the information's CUI status when disseminating that information.\r\n *  â€¢ Disseminating occurs when authorized holders provide access, transmit, or transfer CUI to other authorized holders through any means, whether internal or external to the agency.\r\n\r\nOnce designated as CUI, US Federal Agencies and their contractors must assign CUI marks as prescribed by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) CUI Registry, and display marks as prescribed by the CUI Marking Handbook.\r\n\r\nCUI markings must be displayed on hard copy, on containers, electronic media, and to end users for IT systems.\r\n\r\nWhen HL7 content is designated as CUI, these computable markings can be interoperably conveyed using HL7 security label CUI tags, and may be included in HL7 text and narrative elements as human readable markings.\r\n\r\n**Impact of CUI markings:**\r\n\r\nCUI Custodians must enforce CUI security controls per applicable CUI policies. Federal agencies and their contractors must adhere to FISMA and NIST SP 800-53 security controls. Custodians, who are not Federal agencies or agency contractors, and are receivers of CUI, must adhere to NIST SP 800-171 security controls and those dictated by the Authorities indicated by the assigned CUI markings.\r\n\r\nFor most participants in US healthcare information exchange, including Federal Agencies and their contractors, additional controls are required by HIPAA Security standards for health information US 42 USC 1320d-2(d)(2) https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2016-title42/pdf/USCODE-2016-title42-chap7-subchapXI-partC-sec1320d-2.pdf\r\n\r\nFederal Agencies and their contractors may be the CUI classifier of original CUI content; or a CUI derivative classifier, which reclassifies CUI content that has been aggregated with other CUI or Unclassified Uncontrolled Information (U) or dissembled from a larger CUI content; or declassifiers, depending on the designating agency's policies.\r\n\r\nApplicable CUI policies include the following and any future applicable updates to policies or laws related to CUI:\r\n\r\n *  Executive Order 13556 https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2010/11/09/2010-28360/controlled-unclassified-information\r\n *  US 32 CFR Part 2002 https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2017-title32-vol6/pdf/CFR-2017-title32-vol6-part2002.pdf\r\n *  NIST SP 800-171 https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r1.pdf\r\n *  NIST SP 800-171A https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-171A\r\n *  CUI Marking Handbook https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf\r\n *  CUI Registry - Health Information Category https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/category-detail/health-info\r\n *  CUI Registry: Limited Dissemination Controls https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/limited-dissemination\r\n *  CUI Policy and Guidance https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/policy-guidance</td><td/><td>24131</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CPLYJPP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-CPLYJPP\"> </a></td><td>comply with jurisdictional privacy policy</td><td>Custodian security system must retrieve, evaluate, and comply with applicable jurisdictional privacy policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* CPLYJPP may be used as a security label code to inform senders and receivers of information tagged with an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType\\_ActPrivacyPolicy\\_ActPrivacyLaw code or an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType\\_ActInformationPolicy.JurisIP code to comply with applicable jurisdictional privacy policy.</td><td/><td>23380</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CPLYJSP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-CPLYJSP\"> </a></td><td>comply with jurisdictional security policy</td><td>Custodian security system must retrieve, evaluate, and comply with applicable jurisdictional security policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* CPLYJSP may be used as a security label code to inform senders and receivers of information tagged with an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType.SecurityPolicy code to comply with applicable jurisdictional security policy.</td><td/><td>24130</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CPLYOPP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-CPLYOPP\"> </a></td><td>comply with organizational privacy policy</td><td>Custodian security system must retrieve, evaluate, and comply with applicable organizational privacy policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* CPLYOPP may be used as a security label code to inform senders and receivers of information tagged with an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType\\_ActInformationPolicy.OrgIP code to comply with applicable organizational privacy policy.</td><td/><td>23381</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CPLYOSP<a name=\"v3-ActCode-CPLYOSP\"> </a></td><td>comply with organizational security policy</td><td>Custodian security system must retrieve, evaluate, and comply with the organizational security policies associated with the target information.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* CPLYOSP may be used as a security label code to inform senders and receivers of information tagged with an ActCode\\_ActPolicyType.SecurityPolicy code to comply with applicable organizational security policy.</td><td/><td>23382</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>CPLYPOL</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DECLASSIFYLABEL<a name=\"v3-ActCode-DECLASSIFYLABEL\"> </a></td><td>declassify security label</td><td>Custodian security system must declassify information assigned security labels by instantiating a new version of the classified information so as to break the binding of the classifying security label when assigning a new security label that marks the information as unclassified in accordance with applicable jurisdictional privacy policies associated with the target information.

Related Security Control Observation named tag sets are Purpose of Use, Obligation Policy, and Refrain Policy, each with their own Security Control Observation Value tag sets.\r\n\r\nFoundational standard definitions: ISO 22600-3 Section A.3.4.3 - If present, the privacy-mark is not used for access control. The content of the privacy-mark may be defined by the security policy in force (identified by the security-policy-identifier) which may define a list of values to be used. Alternately, the value may be determined by the originator of the security-label. IEEE Security Glossary Compendium 93- CESG Memorandum No.1 Issue 1.2 Oct 1992 - Human readable word or phrase acting as an indicator of all or part of the security constraints that apply to a document so marked. NOTE: A machine readable representation of a marking.\r\n\r\n*Comment:* While policies requiring creators, processors, custodians, senders or recipients apply, enforce, and persist applicable Privacy Marks may be dictated by a jurisdiction, organization or personal privacy, security, or integrity policy, those required to comply may be governed under different policies, so compliance may need to be enforced through trust contracts. For example, information content marked with GDPR related policies may require adherence by processors or recipients outside of the European Union. For this reason, this code system is likely to evolve with the inclusion of multiple policy domains needing to communicate encoded policies in a standard, interoperable manner.</td><td/><td>24045</td><td>active</td><td>true</td><td/><td/><td>SecurityPolicy</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ControlledUnclassifiedInformation<a name=\"v3-ActCode-ControlledUnclassifiedInformation\"> </a></td><td>ControlledUnclassifiedInformation</td><td>Information the US Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls.

Agency heads may approve the required use of CUI Portion marking on all CUI generated within their agency. As such, users should consult their agency CUI policy when creating CUI documents. When CUI Portion Markings are used and a portion does not contain CUI a â€œUâ€? is placed in parentheses to indicate that the portion contains Uncontrolled Unclassified Information. (Page 14)\r\n\r\nCUI Portion Markings are placed at the beginning of the portion to which they apply and must be used throughout the entire document. They are presented in all capital letters and separated as indicated in this handbook and the CUI Registry. The presence of EVEN ONE item of CUI in a document requires CUI marking of that document. Because of this, CUI Portion Markings can be of great assistance in determining if a document contains CUI and therefore must be marked as such. Remember: When portion markings are used and any portion does not contain CUI, a â€œ(U)â€? is placed in front of that portion to indicate that it contains Uncontrolled - or non-CUI - Unclassified Information.

The federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record that identifies a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose (see Â§ 2.31). The federal rules restrict any use of the information to investigate or prosecute with regard to a crime any patient with a substance use disorder, except as provided at Â§Â§ 2.12(c)(5) and 2.65; or (2) 42 CFR part 2 prohibits unauthorized disclosure of these records. https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/2.32\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* Example of marking requirement from SAMHSA FAQ Response to question 13:\r\n\r\nWould a logon or splash page notification on an HIOâ€™s portal that contains the Part 2 notice prohibiting redisclosure be sufficient to meet Part 2â€™s requirement that disclosures made with patient consent be accompanied by such a statement?\r\n\r\nNo. Part 2 requires each disclosure made with written patient consent to be accompanied by a written statement that the information disclosed is protected by federal law and that the recipient cannot make any further disclosure of it unless permitted by the regulations (42 CFR Â§ 2.32). A logon page is the page where a user logs onto a computer system; a splash page is an introductory page to a web site. A logon or splash page notification on a HIO's portal including the statement as required by Â§ 2.32 would not be sufficient notification regarding prohibitions on redisclosure since it would not accompany a specific disclosure. The notification must be tied to the Part 2 information being disclosed in order to ensure that the recipient of that information knows that specific information is protected by Part 2 and cannot be redisclosed except as authorized by the express written consent of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by Part 2. https://www.samhsa.gov/about-us/who-we-are/laws-regulations/confidentiality-regulations-faqs</td><td/><td>24049</td><td>active</td><td/><td/><td/><td>SecurityLabelMark</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td style=\"white-space:nowrap\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RestrictedConfidentialityMark<a name=\"v3-ActCode-RestrictedConfidentialityMark\"> </a></td><td>restricted confidentiality mark</td><td>A displayed mark rendered to end users as &quot;Restricted Confidentiality&quot;, which indicates that the electronic or hardcopy information they are viewing, must be protected at a restricted level of confidentiality protection as defined by HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot; (restricted). Examples: Includes information that is additionally protected such as sensitive conditions mental health, HIV, substance abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, genetic disease, and reproductive health; or sensitive demographic information such as a patient's standing as an employee or a celebrity. Use cases include a display to alert authorized EHR users that they are viewing additionally protected health information deemed sensitive by an applicable jurisdictional, organizational, or personal privacy policy.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* The definition is based on HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot; (restricted), which is described as:\r\n\r\nPrivacy metadata indicating highly sensitive, potentially stigmatizing information, which presents a high risk to the information subject if disclosed without authorization. May be pre-empted by jurisdictional law, e.g., for public health reporting or emergency treatment. Foundational definitions of Confidentiality: From HL7 Confidentiality Concept Domain: Types of privacy metadata classifying an IT resource (data, information object, service, or system capability) according to its level of sensitivity, which is based on an analysis of applicable privacy policies and the risk of financial, reputational, or other harm to an individual or entity that could result if made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.\r\n\r\nUsage Note from HL7 Confidentiality code &quot;R&quot;: Confidentiality codes may be used in security labels and privacy markings to classify IT resources based on sensitivity to indicate the obligation of a custodian or receiver to ensure that the protected resource is not made available or disclosed to individuals, entities, or processes (security principals) unless authorized per applicable policies. Confidentiality codes may also be used in the clearances of initiators requesting access to protected resources.\r\n\r\nThis metadata indicates that the receiver may be obligated to comply with applicable, prevailing (default) jurisdictional privacy law or disclosure authorization.\r\n\r\nMap: Definition aligns with ISO 7498-2:1989 - Confidentiality is the property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (3) Clinical Care: Default for normal clinical care access (i.e. most clinical staff directly caring for the patient should be able to access nearly all of the EHR).

Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions. The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly. A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss. An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer. A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:* In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy. The policy holder may be the covered party, a relative of the covered party, a partnership, or a corporation, e.g., an employer. A subscriber of a self-insured health insurance policy is a policy holder. A subscriber of an employer sponsored health insurance policy is holds a certificate of coverage, but is not a policy holder; the policy holder is the employer.

A program is an organized structure for administering and funding coverage of a benefit package for covered parties meeting eligibility criteria, typically related to employment, health, financial, and demographic status. Programs are typically established or permitted by legislation with provisions for ongoing government oversight. Regulations may mandate the structure of the program, the manner in which it is funded and administered, covered benefits, provider types, eligibility criteria and financial participation. A government agency may be charged with implementing the program in accordance to the regulation. Risk of loss under a program in most cases would not meet what an underwriter would consider an insurable risk, i.e., the risk is not random in nature, not financially measurable, and likely requires subsidization with government funds.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:* Programs do not have policy holders or subscribers. Program eligibles are enrolled based on health status, statutory eligibility, financial status, or age. Program eligibles who are covered parties under the program may be referred to as members, beneficiaries, eligibles, or recipients. Programs risk are underwritten by not for profit organizations such as governmental entities, and the beneficiaries typically do not pay for any or some portion of the cost of coverage.

For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:*A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"active"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"22148"},{"code":"subsumedBy","valueCode":"_ActInsuranceTypeCode"}]},{"code":"PNC","display":"property and casualty insurance policy","definition":"**Definition:** A type of insurance that covers damage to or loss of the policyholderaTMs property by providing payments for damages to property damage or the injury or death of living subjects.

Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.\r\n\r\nFor example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description: Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles. A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy). These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine. A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy. When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information. This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.\r\n\r\n*Usage Note:* Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements. For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain. 'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly. Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply. Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly. The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.","property":[{"code":"notSelectable","valueBoolean":true},{"code":"status","valueCode":"active"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"23329"},{"code":"subsumedBy","valueCode":"_ActPrivacyPolicy"}]},{"code":"COMPT","display":"compartment","definition":"This is the healthcare analog to the US Intelligence Community's concept of a Special Access Program.
