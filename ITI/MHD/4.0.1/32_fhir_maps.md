## 3:4.5 FHIR Representation of Document Sharing Metadata

This section documents the mapping between IHE [Document Sharing Metadata](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume3/ch-4.1.html#4.1) and the FHIR Resources. 

### 3:4.5.1 Metadata Object Types mapped to FHIR

For details on FHIR resources and data types see HL7 FHIR http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html.

Some Document Sharing Metadata attributes must be treated as `contained` FHIR Resources. These are indicated in with a "Note 1” and the word `contained`. The details of the FHIR `contained` mechanism is found at http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/references.html#contained.

When encoding XDS identifiers into FHIR Resource data elements of type Identifier, the FHIR notation of OIDs and UUIDs uses the system identifier of `urn:ietf:rfc:3986`. For more details and examples, see [ITI TF-2: Appendix E.3 “FHIR Identifier Type”](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_Appx-Z.pdf).

#### 3:4.5.1.1 DocumentEntry Metadata Attributes {#documentEntry}

The documented [mapping of the metadata elements](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Minimal.DocumentReference-mappings.html#mappings-for-xds-and-mhd-mapping-xds) associated with a [Document Sharing DocumentEntry object](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume3/ch-4.2.html#4.2.3.2) attributes.

Note: FHIR contains an informative mapping that is intended to be equivalent and can be found at http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documentreference-mappings.html#xds. For the purposes of IHE MHD conformance the mapping documented here (in IHE) are normative.

##### 3:4.5.1.2 DocumentReference StructureDefinition
The conformance requirements are different between a Provide Document Bundle [ITI-65](ITI-65.html) transaction and a Find Document References [ITI-67](ITI-67.html) transaction, and between Minimal Metadata, Comprehensive Metadata, and UnContained References.

The conformance requirements are different between Comprehensive, minimal, and UnContained References. The canonical URI is found as the "Defining URL:":
* [Comprehensive DocumentReference Metadata](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Comprehensive.DocumentReference.html)
* [Comprehensive DocumentReference UnContained References](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.UnContained.Comprehensive.DocumentReference.html)
* [Minimal DocumentReference Metadata](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Minimal.DocumentReference.html)
* Minimal DocumentReference does not include `contained` requirements

Resources are not required to carry the meta.profile element and may only carry the profile element defined for the Provide Document Bundle [ITI-65] transaction, as the Receiver is not required to add the profile tags. The value of the meta.profile is a soft indicator of conformance expectation. Receivers may choose to validate actual conformance and fail transactions due to non-conformance.

#### 3:4.5.2 SubmissionSet Metadata Attributes {#submissionSet}

The documented [mapping of the metadata elements](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Minimal.SubmissionSet-mappings.html#mappings-for-xds-and-mhd-mapping-xds) associated with a [Document Sharing SubmissionSet object](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume3/ch-4.2.html#4.2.3.3) attributes.

##### 3:4.5.2.1 SubmissionSet List StructureDefinition
The conformance requirements are different between Comprehensive, Minimal, and UnContained References. The canonical URI is found as the "Defining URL:":
* [Comprehensive SubmissionSet Metadata](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Comprehensive.SubmissionSet.html)
* [Comprehensive SubmissionSet UnContained References](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.UnContained.Comprehensive.SubmissionSet.html)
* [Minimal SubmissionSet Metadata](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Minimal.SubmissionSet.html)
* Minimal SubmissionSet Metadata does not include `contained` requirements

Resources are not required to carry the meta.profile element and may only carry the profile element defined for the Provide Document Bundle [ITI-65](ITI-65.html) transaction, as the Receiver is not required to add the profile tags. The value of the meta.profile is a soft indicator of conformance expectation. Receivers may choose to validate actual conformance and fail transactions due to non-conformance.

#### 3:4.5.3 Folder Metadata Attributes {#folder}

The documented [mapping of the metadata elements](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Minimal.Folder-mappings.html#mappings-for-xds-and-mhd-mapping-xds) associated with a [Document Sharing Folder object](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume3/ch-4.2.html#4.2.3.4) attributes.

Note that FHIR List Resource in the FHIR core specification does not include a Mapping to XDS.

##### 3:4.5.3.1 Folder StructureDefinition
The conformance requirements are different between Comprehensive and Minimal metadata. The canonical URI is found as the "Defining URL:":
* [Comprehensive Folder Metadata](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Comprehensive.Folder.html)
* Comprehensive Folder Metadata does not include `contained` requirements
* [Minimal Folder Metadata](StructureDefinition-IHE.MHD.Minimal.Folder.html)
* Minimal Folder Metadata does not include `contained` requirements

Resources are not required to carry the meta.profile element and may only carry the profile element defined for the Provide Document Bundle [ITI-65](ITI-65.html) transaction, as the Receiver is not required to add the profile tags. The value of the meta.profile is a soft indicator of conformance expectation. Receivers may choose to validate actual conformance and fail transactions due to non-conformance.
