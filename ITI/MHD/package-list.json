This makes less the burden on the Document Source to seralize the content into an appropriate Binary format, as that requirement is moved to the Document Recipient. There are use-cases where the Document Recipient will use the FHIR Document Bundle directly, and there are requirements on the Document Recipient to seralize the FHIR Document Bundle when grouped with non-FHIR Actors like XDS/XDR/XDM.\r\n     - This is added as an option at this time to keep base compatibility with existing MHD. This may become normal functionality of ITI-65 eventually\r\n   - Each of these new options may survive or may be removed. Please voice your interest, and sign up for IHE-Connectathon to test these options. Based on interest these Options may survive or be removed.\r\n - better clarity on types of Identifier\r\n - a method has been added to support DocumentReference replace that is used by the Document Source to mark the old/replaced DocumentReference instance as superseded.","changes":"a_issues.html","current":true},{"version":"4.2.0-ballot","desc":"Public Comment for new features including alignment with BasicAudit, Generate Metadata, Simplified Publish, and Publish of FHIR-Documents.","path":"https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/4.2.0-ballot","status":"ballot","fhirversion":"4.0.1","sequence":"Publication","date":"2022-10-21"},{"version":"4.1.0","desc":"Trial Implementation - Technical Corrections and google analytics","path":"https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/4.1.0","status":"trial-use","fhirversion":"4.0.1","sequence":"Publication","date":"2022-02-28"},{"version":"4.0.2","date":"2021-11-08","desc":"Trial Implementation - IHE look-and-feel style change","path":"https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/4.0.2","status":"trial-use","fhirversion":"4.0.1","sequence":"Publication"},{"version":"4.0.1","date":"2021-06-04","desc":"Trial Implementation","path":"https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/4.0.1","status":"trial-use","fhirversion":"4.0.1","sequence":"Publication"},{"version":"4.0.0-comment","date":"2021-04-02","desc":"Public Comment release for first IG authored version","path":"https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/MHD/4.0.0","status":"ballot","fhirversion":"4.0.1","sequence":"Publication"},{"version":"3.2.0","date":"2020-08-28","desc":"Last PDF Trial Implementation","path":"https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/ITI/IHE_ITI_Suppl_MHD_Rev3-2_TI_2020-08-28.pdf","status":"trial-use","fhirversion":"4.0.1","sequence":"Publication"}]}
