  "introduction" : "The Mobile Aggregate Data Exchange (mADX) Profile supports interoperable public health reporting of aggregate health data. These most typically take the form of routine reports (weekly, monthly, quarterly etc.) from a health facility to some administrative jurisdiction such as a health district, though there are numerous other use cases such as international reporting and community health worker reporting."
