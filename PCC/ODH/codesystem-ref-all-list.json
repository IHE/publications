Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.",

The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.\r\n\r\nConceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode.

For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code \"potassium\" together with and Act.classCode for \"laboratory observation\" to somehow mean \"potassium laboratory observation\" and then use the same Act.code for \"potassium\" together with Act.classCode for \"medication\" to mean \"substitution of potassium\".
