          <h2 id="1.3">1.3 How this Volume is Organized</h2>
          <p>Section 2 describes the general nature, structure, purpose and function of the Technical Framework. Section 3 and the subsequent sections of this volume provide detailed documentation on each integration profile, including the Patient Care Coordination problem it is intended to address and the IHE actors and transactions it comprises.</p>
          <p>The appendices following the main body of the document provide a summary list of the actors and transactions, detailed discussion of specific issues related to the integration profiles and a glossary of terms and acronyms used.</p>
          <h2 id="1.4">1.4 Conventions Used in this Document</h2>
          <p>This document has adopted the following conventions for representing the framework concepts and specifying how the standards upon which the IHE Technical Framework is based should be applied.</p>
          <h3 id="1.4.1">1.4.1 Technical Framework Cross-references</h3>
          <p>When references are made to another section within a Technical Framework volume, a section number is used by itself. When references are made to other volumes or to a Technical Framework in another domain, the following format is used:</p>
          <p><code>&lt;domain designator&gt; TF-&lt;volume number&gt;: &lt;section number&gt;</code></p>
          <p>where:</p>
          <p><code>&lt;domain designator&gt;</code> is a short designator for the IHE domain (e.g. PCC for Patient Care Coordination, ITI for IT Infrastructure, RAD for Radiology)</p>
          <p><code>&lt;volume number&gt;</code> is the applicable volume within the given Domain Technical Framework (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4), and</p>
          <p><code>&lt;section number&gt;</code> is the applicable section number.</p>
          <p>For example: IHE PCC TF-1: 3.1 refers to Section 3.1 in volume 1 of the IHE Patient Care Coordination Technical Framework, IHE ITI TF-2: 4.33 refers to Section 4.33 in volume 2 of the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework.</p>
          <h3 id="1.4.2">1.4.2 IHE Actor and Transaction Diagrams and Tables</h3>
          <p>Each integration profile is a representation of a real-world capability that is supported by a set of actors that interact through transactions. Actors are information systems or components of information systems that produce, manage, or act on categories of information required by operational activities in the enterprise. Transactions are interactions between actors that communicate the required information through standards-based messages. The diagrams and tables of actors and transactions in subsequent sections indicate which transactions each actor in a given profile must support.</p>
          <p>The transactions shown on the diagrams are identified both by their name and the transaction number as defined in PCC TF-2 (Volume 2 of the PCC Technical Framework). The transaction numbers are shown on the diagrams as bracketed numbers prefixed with the specific Technical Framework domain.</p>
          <p>In some cases, a profile is dependent on a prerequisite profile in order to function properly and be useful. For example, Cross-Enterprise Sharing of Medical Summaries depends on Audit Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA). These dependencies can be found by locating the desired profile in the dependencies section of this document to determine which profile(s) are listed as prerequisites. An actor must implement all required transactions in the prerequisite profiles in addition to those in the desired profile.</p>
          <h3 id="1.4.3">1.4.3 Process Flow Diagrams</h3>
          <p>The descriptions of integration profiles that follow include process flow diagrams that illustrate how the profile functions as a sequence of transactions between relevant actors.</p>
          <p>These diagrams are intended to provide an overview so the transactions can be seen in the context of an institution's or cross-institutions' workflow. Certain transactions and activities not defined in detail by IHE are shown in these diagrams in italics to provide additional context on where the relevant IHE transactions fit into the broader scheme of healthcare information systems. These diagrams are not intended to present the only possible scenario. Often other actor groupings are possible, and transactions from other profiles may be interspersed.</p>
          <p>In some cases the sequence of transactions may be flexible. Where this is the case there will generally be a note pointing out the possibility of variations. Transactions are shown as arrows oriented according to the flow of the primary information handled by the transaction and not necessarily the initiator.</p>

          <h2 id="1.6">1.6 Introduction</h2>
          <p>The IHE Patient Care Coordination Technical Framework (PCC TF) defines specific implementations of established standards. These are intended to achieve integration goals that promote appropriate exchange of medical information to coordinate the optimal patient care among care providers in different care settings. It is expanded annually, after a period of public review, and maintained regularly through the identification and correction of errata. The latest version of the PCC TF is always available online at <a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/" target="_blank">https://profiles.ihe.net/</a>, where the technical framework volumes specific to the various healthcare domains addressed by IHE may be found.</p>
          <p>The IHE Patient Care Coordination Technical Framework identifies a subset of the functional components of the healthcare enterprises and health information networks, called IHE actors, and specifies their interactions in terms of a set of coordinated, standards-based transactions. The other domains within the IHE initiative also produce Technical Frameworks within their respective areas that together form the IHE Technical Framework. A complete listing of the other IHE domains and their Technical Frameworks is available at <a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/" target="_blank">https://profiles.ihe.net/</a>. Some of the other IHE Technical Framework(s) that are available are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="bullet-list1"><a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/" target="_blank">IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework</a></li>
            <li class="bullet-list1"><a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/CARD/" target="_blank">IHE Cardiology Technical Framework</a></li>
            <li class="bullet-list1"><a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/PaLM/" target="_blank">IHE Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Technical Framework</a></li>
            <li class="bullet-list1"><a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/RAD/" target="_blank">IHE Radiology Technical Framework</a></li>
            <li class="bullet-list1"><a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/QRPH/" target="_blank">IHE Quality, Research and Public Health Technical Framework</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Where applicable, references are made to other technical frameworks. For the conventions on referencing other frameworks, see <a href="#1.4.1">section 1.4.1</a> above.</p>
          <h3 id="1.6.1">1.6.1 Relationship to Standards</h3>
          <p>The IHE Technical Framework identifies functional components of a distributed healthcare environment (referred to as IHE actors), solely from the point of view of their interactions in the healthcare enterprise. It further defines a coordinated set of transactions based on standards developed by Standards Developing Organizations (such as HL7, IETF, ASTM, DICOM, ISO, OASIS, etc.) in order to accomplish a particular use case. As the scope of the IHE initiative expands, transactions based on other standards may be included as required.</p>
          <p>At its current level of development, IHE has also created Content Integration Profiles to further specify the payloads of these transactions, again based on standards. This has become necessary as the healthcare industry moves towards the use of transaction standards that have been used in more traditional computing environments.</p>
          <p>In some cases, IHE recommends selection of specific options supported by these standards. However, IHE does not introduce technical choices that contradict conformance to these standards. If errors in or extensions to existing standards are identified, IHE's policy is to report them to the appropriate standards bodies for resolution within their conformance and standards evolution strategy.</p>
          <p>IHE is therefore an implementation framework, not a standard. Conformance claims for products must still be made in direct reference to specific standards. In addition, vendors who have implemented IHE integration capabilities in their products may publish IHE Integration Statements to communicate their products' capabilities. Vendors publishing IHE Integration Statements accept full responsibility for their content. By comparing the IHE Integration Statements from different products, a user familiar with the IHE concepts of actors and integration profiles can determine the level of integration between them. See <a href="https://profiles.ihe.net/GeneralIntro/ch-F.html" target="_blank">Appendix F of the IHE General Introduction</a> for the format of IHE Integration Statements.</p>
          <h3 id="1.6.2">1.6.2 Relationship to Product Implementations</h3>
          <p>The IHE actors and transactions described in the IHE Technical Framework are abstractions of the real-world healthcare information system environment. While some of the transactions are traditionally performed by specific product categories (e.g., HIS, Clinical Data Repository, Electronic Health record systems, Radiology Information Systems, Clinical Information Systems or Cardiology Information Systems), the IHE Technical Framework intentionally avoids associating functions or actors with such product categories. For each actor, the IHE Technical Framework defines only those functions associated with integrating information systems. The IHE definition of an actor should therefore not be taken as the complete definition of any product that might implement it, nor should the framework itself be taken to comprehensively describe the architecture of a healthcare information system.</p>
          <p>The reason for defining actors and transactions is to provide a basis for defining the interactions among functional components of the healthcare information system environment. In situations where a single physical product implements multiple functions, only the interfaces between the product and external functions in the environment are considered to be significant by the IHE initiative. Therefore, the IHE initiative takes no position as to the relative merits of an integrated environment based on a single, all-encompassing information system versus one based on multiple systems that together achieve the same end.</p>
          <h3 id="1.6.3">1.6.3 Framework Development and Maintenance</h3>
          <p>The IHE Patient Care Coordination Technical Framework is continuously maintained and
          expanded on an annual basis by the IHE Patient Care Coordination Technical Committee. The
          development and maintenance process of the Framework follows a number of principles to
          ensure stability of the specification so that both vendors and users may use it reliably in
          specifying, developing and acquiring systems with IHE integration capabilities.</p>
          <p>The first of these principles is that any extensions or clarifications to the Technical Framework must maintain backward compatibility with previous versions of the framework (except in rare cases for corrections) in order to maintain interoperability with systems that have implemented IHE Actors and Integration Profiles defined there. The IHE Patient Care Coordination Technical Framework is developed and re-published annually following a three-step process:</p>
          <ul>
              <li class="bullet-list1">The Patient Care Coordination Technical Committee develops supplements to the current
                  stable version of the Technical Framework to support new functionality identified by the
                  IHE Strategic and PCC Planning Committees and issues them for public comment.</li>
              <li class="bullet-list1">The Committee addresses all comments received during the public comment period and
                  publishes an updated version of the Technical Framework for <em>Trial Implementation</em>.
                  This version contains both the stable body of the Technical Framework from the
                  preceding cycle and the newly developed supplements. It is this version of the Technical
                  Framework that is used by vendors in developing trial implementation software for the
                  IHE Connectathons.</li>
              <li class="bullet-list1">The Committee regularly considers change proposals to the <em>Trial Implementation</em> version of the Technical Framework, including those from implementers who participate in the Connectathon. After resolution of all change proposals received within 60 days of the Connectathon, the Technical Framework version is published as <em>Final Text</em>.</li>
          </ul> 
          <p>As part of the Technical Framework maintenance the Committee will consider change proposals received after the publication to the <em>Final Text</em>.</p>
