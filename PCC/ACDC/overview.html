<p>Assessments are the principle means by which numerous forms of data
regarding physical function, mental/cognitive status, social
determinants of health, and patient reported outcomes are collected.
These are variously known as assessments, screening instruments, scales,
scores, questionnaires</p>

<p>Many assessment instruments have been automated, but there are thousands
of these instruments. HealthMeasures<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">1</a></sup> has nearly 750 measures, the
Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute at the University of Washington<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
lists over 1031 screening instruments, and a search of PubMed<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">3</a></sup>
results in nearly 26,000 articles on different instruments used for
patient assessment.</p>

<p>In the US, more than a half dozen quality improvement or recognition
programs require documenting or reporting specific information about
patients that contain elements that can be obtained from health
assessments<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.
These are shown in <a href="#fig4-1">figure 15.4-1</a> below.</p>

<p><span id="fig4-1"> </span><img src="QualityRelatedAssessments.png" alt="Quality Related Assessments" title="Quality Related Assessments"/></p>
<div style="clear: left"></div>
<p><strong>Figure 15.4-1 Quality Related Assessments</strong></p>

<p>Many of these instruments can be implemented using technology, as they are simple forms or questionnaires.
Some data in these instruments might be automatically populated by the EHR system.  However, because there
are so many instruments, and so many providers of the instruments, it is challenging to integrate these
instruments into provider workflows.</p>

<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>

<p>Assessment instruments are tools which enable clinicians to assess a
patient’s clinical condition based on certain evaluations or
observations performed with the patient. Evaluations may include the
recording of clinical data that is captured by other means (e.g.,
measurement tools) or by simply answering questions based on the
clinician or patient’s knowledge. The result is an assessment that will
provide both the collected data and an assessment of what that means for
the condition being assessed.</p>

<p>Assessments may be used for screening, diagnosis, treatment
determination, or reporting of outcomes. Assessment instruments are used
to gather data on a wide variety of clinical conditions. One well known
example of an assessment instrument is the American College of
Cardiology’s ASCVD Risk Estimator<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. This instrument provides an
estimation of a patients’ 10-year ASCVD risk. It appears in the <a href="#fig4.1-1">figure
below</a>.</p>

<p><span id="fig4.1-1"> </span><img src="assessmentinstrumentexample.png" alt="An Assessment Instrument" title="An Assessment Instrument"/></p>
<div style="clear: left"></div>
<p><strong>Figure 15.4.1-1 An Assessment Instrument</strong></p>

<p>Both the gathered data in the assessment and the resulting assessment
can be used for later evaluation, either for clinical care or to support
health research.</p>

<p>As a clinical tool used in the delivery of care, assessment instruments
often go through evaluation and validation, and include training
materials on how the assessment is to be performed<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. Changes to the
questions asked, or the possible responses allowed results in a
different diagnostic instrument, which may or may not perform as well as
the validated instrument. Therefore, developers of assessment
instruments often accompany them with intellectual property controls
that ensure they are implemented appropriately. Many assessment
instruments were originally implemented as paper forms, but with the
growth of the web, these are now often implemented as electronic forms.
Because of the intellectual property controls, instrument developers may
restrict online use to a validated implementation.</p>

<p>This results in a challenge for healthcare providers because each
instrument they choose to use may have different user interfaces,
different initiation protocols and delivery mechanisms, and require
different ways to be integrated into their electronic health record
systems. The purpose of this profile is to provide a way for these
instruments to be readily integrated into the EHR.</p>

<p>Because many of these instruments rely on data that is already known to
the EHR, there is further value in enabling a connection between the EHR
and the system delivering the assessment instrument content so that
information that is already known to the EHR can be supplied to the
assessment instrument delivery system.</p>

<p>In this profile, the assessment instrument is represented as a FHIR
Questionnaire resource. The questionnaire resource is designed to
support collection of data based on answers from end users and enables
detailed control over presentation of the instrument. The responses to
the assessment instrument are represented in the FHIR
QuestionnaireResponse resource. This resource provides the list of
questions, answers and additional data (e.g., assessments, scores, et
cetera) determined from the answers to the questions.</p>

<p>The <a href="#fig4.1-2">figure below</a> illustrates the abstract implementation model for
working with assessments for patient reported outcomes[9] as published
in the HL7 FHIR Patient Reported Outcomes Implementation Guide. While
this model was developed for patient reported outcome assessments, it
can be applied to other forms of assessment as well.</p>

<p><span id="fig4.1-2"> </span><img src="pro-abstract-model-basic.png" alt="Abstract Model for Basic Questionnaires" title="Abstract Model for Basic Questionnaires"/></p>
<div style="clear: left"></div>
<p><strong>Figure 15.4.1-2 Abstract Model for Basic Questionnaires</strong></p>

<p>The ACDC profile focuses on steps 2 through 5 of the model and
implements these steps using four different actors. The first use case
in this profile, corresponding to step 2 in the diagram above, is to
identify the assessment instrument that the healthcare provider wants to
integrate into their workflow. The PROM Instrument and Metadata
repository in this diagram would support assessment instrument retrieval
by implementing the Clinical Knowledge Resource Repository Actor. The
External PRO Administration System or EHR or Care Delivery Health IT
system could then retrieve instruments by implementing the Artifact
Consumer actor. This enables the assessment instrument to be selected by
the healthcare provider.</p>

<p>The second use case in this profile addresses steps 3 through 5 in
<a href="#fig4.1-2">Figure 15.4.1-2</a>, which is the execution of the assessment instrument.</p>

<h4 id="use-of-assessment-instrument-results">Use of Assessment Instrument Results</h4>

<p>This profile makes no assumptions about how assessment results are used
after they are returned to the Assessment Requester application. The
results may be stored in the provider’s health IT system, they may be
used to produce other information that is stored in the patient’s chart,
data may be extracted from the assessment to produce a care plan, they
may be discussed with the patient, et cetera. There is no responsibility
on the receiving system to persist or store the results or otherwise
make them accessible for future use, they may simply be discarded after
being produced and acted upon. There may be some requirements in the
providers jurisdiction that requires that the data used in the
assessment be persisted in some way, that is outside of the scope of
this profile<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>resource returned by the Assessor actor.</p>

<p>This profile does require that the Assessment Requester actor expose a
FHIR endpoint that supports the QuestionnaireResponse create operation.
That does not create a commitment on the Assessment Requester actor to
expose endpoints supporting the read or search operations. It is simply
a convenience used to enable a stateless application to be launched and
return results from its operations.</p>

<h3 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h3>
<p>The sections below describe the use cases supported by the IHE ACDC Profile.</p>

<h4 id="use-case-1-finding-an-assessment-instrument">Use Case #1: Finding an Assessment Instrument</h4>

<h5 id="use-case-1-description">Use Case #1 Description</h5>

<p>In the first use case, a care provider organization is seeking
information about assessment instruments to address a specified
condition or health concern. Their goal is to identify instruments and
eventually acquire instruments which could be used to capture
information essential to management of the care of patients having that
condition. Their EHR will be able to perform the assessment once it has
been acquired.</p>

<p><a name="47d68d92-4993-4407-89ea-54069014b9e4">​</a>This use case is supported by the <a href="actorsandtransactions.html#pcc-x1">IHE PCC 71 Query Artifact transaction</a>.</p>

<h5 id="154212-use-case-1-process-flow">15.4.2.1.2 Use Case #1 Process Flow</h5>
<p><span id="fig4.2.1-1"> </span><img src="usecase1-processflow.svg" alt="Use Case #1 Process Flow in ACDC Profile" title="Use Case \#1 Process Flow in ACDC Profile"/></p>
<div style="clear: left"></div>
<p><strong>Figure 15.4.2.1-1: Use Case #1 Process Flow in ACDC Profile</strong></p>

<p>The Query Artifact transaction is used to request lists of one or more
artifacts that match the users search criteria. The metadata for the
artifacts matching the criteria is returned so that the user can further
explore these artifacts to consider acquisition of them for use in their
health information system.</p>

<p>After identifying an artifact for implementation, the user can either
retrieve the full artifact so that it can be implemented in their health
information system, or a link to where it has been externally
implemented so that they integrated it the collected data into their
system, which is described in more detail in
<a href="#fig4.2.1-1">15.4.2.2 Use Case #2 Executing the Assessment Instrument</a>.</p>

<h4 id="use-case-2-executing-the-assessment-instrument">Use Case #2: Executing the Assessment Instrument</h4>

<h5 id="use-case-2-description">Use Case #2 Description</h5>
<p>In the second use case, the care provider organization wants to assess a
patient using the retrieved or identified assessment in their health IT
system and be able to collect the results of this assessment for a given
patient. This process may be initiated through the user’s EHR, a
separate application or device, a patient portal, et cetera.</p>

<p>In this use case, there are several possible ways the assessment data
can be collected.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The provider’s Health IT system can invoke a separate application
that can interpret the assessment instrument and collect data on the
patient, returning it to the health IT solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A separate application can be launched either manually by the
provider or through an integration method not specified by this
guide. This application will integrate with the provider’s Health IT
system to determine which assessment is to be performed, for which
patient and which encounter. It will then collect the data and
return it the EHR attached to the correct patient and encounter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The provider’s Health IT system can initiate data capture on its own
forms, using the data describing the assessment instrument. To
implement this option, the health IT system needs to correctly
interpret instrument description, collect the data and do what it
deems necessary with the data that was collected (e.g., create
observations or other resources, store a questionnaire response, et
cetera). Because this case can be completely managed by the
provider’s Health IT system when the questionnaire items are
provided, it is not addressed within this profile.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>During the execution of this use case, the software performing the
assessment may collect data already known about the patient that is
stored in the health IT system that will receive the assessment results.
When the EHR Launch option is used, this data can be accessed via FHIR
resources from the launching EHR system.</p>

<p><a name="c3bed2c2-5de2-400d-a40d-b56cf9f1a982">​</a>This use case is supported by the <a href="actorsandtransactions.html#pcc-x3">IHE PCC 72 Request Assessment</a>,
and the <a href="actorsandtransactions.html#pcc-x4">IHE PCC 73 Report Assessment</a> transactions.</p>

<h5 id="use-case-2-process-flows">Use Case #2 Process Flows</h5>

<p><span id="fig4.2.2-1"> </span>
<img src="usecase2-processflow.svg" alt="Use Case #2 Process Flow in ACDC Profile" title="Use Case \#2 Process Flow in ACDC Profile"/></p>
<div style="clear: left"></div>
<p><strong>Figure 15.4.2.2-1: Use Case #2 Process Flow in ACDC Profile</strong></p>

<p>In this use case, the first step is to associate the assessment
instrument with a context available in the health IT system (shown below
as the Assessment Requestor) that will receive the assessment results.
The context at a minimum establishes the subject of the assessment: the
patient being assessed, and the user information that might be
associated with any provenance for the assessment. The context might
also include the provider requesting the assessment, and the encounter
in which the assessment is performed.</p>

<p>This first step may be implemented via process in which the healthcare
provider orders an assessment be performed or may be initiated via a
SMART on FHIR <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/#ehr-launch-sequence">EHR Launch flow</a>.
At the end of this step, the patient or provider is presented with a
user interface that enables them to complete the assessment.</p>

<p>The next step performs the assessment. During this step, the assessor
may collect additional data from the receiving health IT system to
facilitate completion of the assessment. The software performing the
assessment may connect to the user’s health IT system in order to
perform queries (e.g., using the IHE QEDm or PDQm profile, or through
other methods).</p>

<p>Upon completion of the assessment, the assessor records the results of
the assessment in a QuestionnaireResponse resource stored by the
Assessment Requester actor and sends it to the Assessment Requestor.</p>
